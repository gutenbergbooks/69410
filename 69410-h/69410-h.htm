<i>The Early Life of Mr. Preemby</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<small>HIS</small> is the story of a certain Mr. Preemby, a retired
laundryman and widower, who abandoned his active
interest in the Limpid Stream Laundry, in the parish of
Saint Simon Unawares, near Woodford Wells, upon the
death of his wife in the year of grace 1920. Some very
remarkable experiences came to him. The story is essentially
a contemporary story: it is a story of London in the
age of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, broadcasting, and the first
Labour peers. The historical element in it is insignificant
and partly erroneous, and the future, though implicitly
present, is substantially ignored.</p>

<p>Since washing in London, like the milk trade and baking
and the linen drapery and various other branches of commerce,
is something rather specialized and hereditary and
a little difficult towards outsiders, it is necessary to explain
that Mr. Preemby was not a laundryman born. He had
little of the spirit and go of a true London laundryman.
He married into laundrying. He met a Miss Hossett at
Sheringham in 1899, an heiress and a young lady of great
decision of character; he wooed and won her and married
her, as you will be told, almost without realizing what he
was doing. The Hossetts are big people in the laundry
world, and the Limpid Stream concern, which presently
fell into the capable hands of Mrs. Preemby, was only one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of a series of related and sympathetic businesses in the
north, north-east and south-west districts of London.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby, as Miss Hossett’s family came to recognize
quite frankly and explicitly at a very early stage, derived
from a less practical strain than his wife. His father had
been an artist of considerable charm and unpunctuality, a
photographic artist, who resided at Sheringham and made
what were called in the eighteen-eighties, “gem” photographs
of the summer visitors to that place. In the
eighteen-eighties he was a well-known Sheringham figure,
dark and handsome and sometimes a little unkempt, wearing
a brown velvet jacket and a large grey soft felt hat. He
would fall into conversation with the visitors upon the
beach, and a certain air of distinction about him would
bring a sufficient proportion to his studio to maintain him.
His wife, our Mr. Preemby’s mother, was a patient, underdeveloped
personality, the daughter of a farmer near Diss.
When presently Mr. Preemby senior passed out of his
son’s life—he became romantically entangled with a small
variety entertainment in the summer of 1887 and vanished
away with it in the autumn with as little fuss as possible,
never to return to Sheringham—Mrs. Preemby senior
became the working partner in a small lodging-house and
died in a year or so’s time, leaving her furniture, her
interest in the lodging-house and her only son to her
cousin and partner, Mrs. Witcherly.</p>

<p>Young Albert Edward Preemby was then a good-looking,
slender youth of sixteen, with his father’s curliness and
his mother’s fair hair and eyes of horizon blue, dreamy and
indisposed for regular employment. Even as a child he
had been given to reverie; at school he would sit with sums
or book neglected before him, looking beyond them at unknown
things; his early experiences in business were disappointing
by reason of this abstraction. After a number
of unsuccessful attempts to exploit his gifts at some favourable
point in the complex machinery of our civilization, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
came to rest for several years in the office of a house-agent
and coal-merchant in Norwich to whom his mother was
distantly related.</p>

<p>Some ancient, remembered, sentimental tie helped
Albert Edward to this appointment and shielded any imperfections
in his performance from too urgent a criticism.
He did much better at it than anyone could have expected.
The calling of a house-agent differs from most other callings
in the fact that the necessary driving energy is supplied
entirely by the clientele, and there was something
about the letting of the larger houses that touched the
dormant imagination of young Preemby. He revealed a
natural gift for attractive description and was duly entrusted
with the work of collecting particulars from prospective
lessors. He had a quite useful hopefulness. And
even the coal proved unexpectedly interesting so soon as
he found that none of it had to be carried about by him.
He could never believe that all the golden scales one finds
in it were pyrites. He cherished a secret dream of a great
commercial enterprise to work cinder heaps for residual
gold. He told no one of this project, he took no steps to
realize it, but it warmed his daily routines with its promise
of release and wealth. And when things were slack in the
office in the early afternoon and he was left in charge, he
would go and sit on the coal counter and pick out the coal
samples for the little trays and turn them over and over
and view them from various angles and weigh them in his
hand and lapse into the most splendid visions.</p>

<p>And if inquirers after houses came in, he would receive
them with a manner almost regal.</p>

<p>In Norwich he became a member of the Y.M.C.A., but
he was interested in its literary rather than its religious
side, and he attended any political debates available. He
never spoke in these debates, but he sat at the back
reflecting that politicians are, after all, no more than puppets
in the hands of the silent rich men who sit behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
scenes. It was in Norwich, too, that he was able to buy his
first tailor-made suit, of a most becoming grey. When he
went to stay with Mrs. Witcherly at Sheringham for his
summer holiday of a fortnight, she was delighted by the
improvement in his appearance and much impressed by the
active hopefulness that had replaced his former lethargy.
Upon the sea front in the afternoon in his grey suit, to
anyone who did not know about him, he might have been
almost any sort of prosperous summer visitor.</p>

<p>It seems a yesterday, and yet it seems ages ago, that our
plump and short Mr. Preemby was that small blonde young
man twirling his stick and glancing furtively but desirously
at the lady bathers in their vast petticoated bathing-dresses
and oilskin caps, as he strolled along the Sheringham
front. That was in the days when motor cars were
still rather a joke, a smell, and a noise and wayside repairs,
and flying was understood to be impossible. Queen
Victoria had had her Diamond Jubilee and nobody thought
Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, would ever survive to be
King. The War in South Africa was being arranged for
that summer, to last six months and employ forty thousand
men. And it was on the third day of his grey suit holiday
at Sheringham that Mr. Preemby was run into by his future
wife, Miss Hossett, riding on a bicycle, and thrown against
and almost run over by her friend Miss Meeta Pinkey.</p>

<p>Because, incredible as it may seem to the modern reader,
people did succeed in those distant nineties, before the
coming of the more suitable automobile, in knocking down
and running over other people with the sluggish apparatus,
bicycles, horse-drawn vehicles and so forth, then available.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>Miss Meeta Pinkey was an emotional blonde girl, and she
fell off her machine gracefully and naturally into Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Preemby’s arms as he was hurled against her. It would
seem to have been the original intention of Destiny to have
made this the beginning of a permanent relationship, but
in this matter Destiny had reckoned without Miss Hossett.
Miss Meeta Pinkey was as ripe for love just then as dry
gunpowder is for a bang, and she was already deeply in
love with Mr. Preemby before she had been replaced
securely on her feet. She stood flushed and round-eyed
and breathless, and Mr. Preemby looked quite manly and
handsome after picking up her bicycle with an air of
rescue.</p>

<p>Miss Hossett, after butting against Mr. Preemby, had
swerved, dismounted and stood now prepared for a dispute.
The collision had further loosened the already loose
handlebar of the entirely untrustworthy hired machine she
had been riding. It was this looseness had caused the accident.
Her attention seemed divided equally between this
and the possible grievance of Mr. Preemby. “I rang my
bell,” she said.</p>

<p>She was flushed and erect. She was a round-faced girl
with a long, thin neck, a good bright complexion, glasses
on her thin nose and a resolute thin-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>“I did all I could to avoid you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Awkward of me,” said Mr. Preemby disarmingly. “I
was lost in a day-dream.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t hurt—?” asked Meeta.</p>

<p>“Startled,” said Mr. Preemby, “especially where the
wheel got me. This place is full of corners.”</p>

<p>“I’d’ve been over,” said Meeta, “if you hadn’t caught
me.”</p>

<p>Miss Hossett was reassured about any possible conflict
with Mr. Preemby. Evidently he was going to be quite
nice about the accident. “This handlebar was as loose as
could be,” she said. “Look at it! You can twist it about
like on a swivel. They ought to be punished for letting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
out such machines. Some of these days one of ’em’ll get
let in for Damages. Then they’ll be a bit more careful.
Scandalous I call it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t ride it at all now,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“No,” she agreed. “Have to take it back to them.”</p>

<p>It seemed only right and proper for Mr. Preemby to
wheel the machine for her back through the town to the
hiring place, where Miss Hossett reproved the hirer, refused
to pay anything, and secured the return of her
deposit in a few well-chosen words. Miss Pinkey paid the
hire of her bicycle for a First Hour. It seemed natural
after that for the little party of three to keep together.
They kept together with a faint sense of adventure, and
Mr. Preemby behaved as nothing less than a normal lodger
at Miss Witcherly’s establishment and summer visitor to
the seaside. His new-found friends were Londoners, and
he referred himself to Norwich and the management of
house property. He was quite amusing about Sheringham.
He said it was “a dear little backward-forward
place,” that it was a real treat to come to for a breath of
sea air.</p>

<p>“I don’t like regular smart places,” said Mr. Preemby.
“I’m too absent-minded.”</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>In after years Mr. Preemby would often try to recall the
various stages that led to his marrying Miss Hossett, but
there was always a vague sense that he missed out something,
though he knew not what it was nor where it ought
to have come in.</p>

<p>At first things did not look in the least like his marrying
Miss Hossett. Indeed they did not look like his marrying
anyone, and if the word marriage had been whispered in
his ears as the possible consequence of this encounter he
would have been terrified. He perceived that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
acceptable company to these girls, but it seemed to him
that it was Meeta who formed the link between them and
himself. A fourth person presently joined their company
who answered to the name of Wilfred, and it seemed to
Mr. Preemby that the air of mutual proprietorship between
Wilfred and Miss Hossett was unchallengeable.</p>

<p>The young people wandered in a little party along the
sea front until the sea front came to an end, and there they
found a sheltered and comparatively secluded niche in the
brow of the low cliffs and gave themselves up to the
delights of Spooning; and it was Meeta who Spooned with
Mr. Preemby that afternoon and Wilfred who Spooned
with Miss Hossett. Across the gulf of a quarter of a century
the memory of Mr. Preemby was still certain that
this was so.</p>

<p>The fashions of life change from age to age. Knowledge
has spread and refinement increased; and a generation of
young people, more restrained, more sophisticated, or more
decisive than their predecessors has taken possession of
the world. This Spooning was an artless, clumsy dalliance
in great favour in those vanished days, a dalliance that was
kept within the bounds of strict decorum—if ever that
became necessary—by cries of “Starp it” or “Starpit, I tell
you,” on the part of the lady. They embraced, they kissed,
and put their silly young heads together and so whiled
away the long waiting-time before love had its way with
them. The summer resorts of England were littered with
young people indulging in these poor, silly, undignified
anticipations of love. Mr. Preemby, it became manifest,
was a natural born Spooner.</p>

<p>“It’s lovely,” said Miss Meeta, “the way you squeeze
me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby squeezed some more and ventured to kiss
a hot ear.</p>

<p>“Go On with you!” said Miss Meeta, in a voice thick
with delight. “That little moustache of yours—it <i>tickles</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Flushed with encouragement and preoccupied with ideas
for further enterprises, Mr. Preemby did not remark that
the affairs of Miss Hossett and her Wilfred followed a
more troubled and less satisfactory course. Wilfred was
not a type that appealed to Mr. Preemby. In spite of the
fact that he was much less neat in his dress than Mr.
Preemby—he had grey flannel trousers, an old fancy vest,
a tweed Norfolk jacket, and low brown shoes with light-coloured
socks—he impressed Mr. Preemby as being consciously
a social superior. He was young—the youngest
of the party—and yet dominant. He had large red hands
and big feet, much untidy hair, ill-regulated features that
might later be handsome, and a hoarse guffaw. He viewed
Mr. Preemby as though he knew all about him and thought
the worse of him for it, but did not intend to make any
positive trouble for the present about his existence. He
was, Meeta whispered, a medical student at Cambridge,
and his father was a Harley Street physician who had been
knighted. He did not Spoon with any abandonment; he
seemed weary of Spooning, he had perhaps been Spooning
for some days, and his conversation with Miss Hossett
went on in subdued contentious tones. He sat a little apart
from her amidst the sand and coarse bluish grass, and her
face was flushed. What they said was inaudible to our
intertwined couple.</p>

<p>“Chris and Wilfred don’t get on together as we do,”
Meeta said in a low voice. “They’re sillies.”</p>

<p>“He’s like all the men,” said Meeta, “’Sept one perhaps.
Want everything they do and give nothing.</p>

<p>“He won’t even say they’re engaged,” she said. “Dodged
seeing her father.”</p>

<p>There was a pause for reflection and then a renewal of
endearments.</p>

<p>“I’m gorne on you,” said Meeta. “I <i>am</i> fair gorne on
you. You’ve got the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen. China
blue they are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>So detachedly it was that Mr. Preemby and his future
wife passed their first afternoon together. He remembered
it, as he remembered most actual things, indistinctly, in a
setting of hot sand and sunshine, blue-grey grass and a
line of poppies nodding against an intense blue sky. And
then across these opening memories Chris Hossett seemed
to leap at him with flushed cheeks and glowing eyes, magnified
by her glasses.</p>

<p>Two or three days intervened before that passionate
pounce. Mr. Preemby, in his character of an incidental
visitor to Sheringham, was under no obligation to produce
a social background, but Miss Pinkey introduced him to
two large, kindly aunts of a sedentary sort, as a young man
related to Miss Hossett who had saved her from a nasty
fall off a bicycle, and he and she both went to tea with
Chris Hossett’s “people.” Old Mr. Hossett was a very ailing
man, excessively fat and irritable; he had never been
the same, whatever the same was, after his only son had
died; and Mrs. Hossett, an energetic lean threat of what
her daughter might become, had to wait on Mr. Hossett
hand and foot. She had spectacles instead of Chris’s
glasses, her eyes were careworn and her complexion was
leaden and her neck lean. There were also a married
cousin and his wife, a Mr. and Mrs. Widgery, who seemed
to be under the impression that Mr. Preemby was a relation
of Miss Pinkey’s. Mr. Widgery had a long pock-marked
face and the dullest brown eyes Mr. Preemby had
ever seen. There was nothing difficult to eat at tea and Mr.
Preemby got on very well listening to an explanation of
the precariousness of Mr. Hossett’s existence, due to heart
trouble, from Mrs. Hossett and of just how unsatisfactory
and distressing it was to come away and leave the laundry
in the hands of a manager. Wilfred did not come to the
tea. He had been asked but he did not come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>The next day Mr. Preemby met Wilfred on the sea front
watching the girls bathing from a bathing machine. Afterwards
all four went for a walk in search of privacy, and
it became evident that Miss Hossett declined to Spoon
further with Wilfred. It was evident that there was profound
trouble between Chris and Wilfred. They scarcely
spoke as they returned towards the town; and before the
sea front was reached Wilfred said “So long” quite suddenly,
and turned away and vanished up a road running
inland. Thereupon Wilfred passed out of Mr. Preemby’s
world; Mr. Preemby never knew what became of him and
never wanted to know; and the next day he became aware
for the first time of Miss Hossett’s magnified eyes, regarding
him with an interest and a challenge that made him
feel almost uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Miss Hossett became a serious obstacle to the Spooning
of Meeta. The quartette was now reduced to a trio; and
Mr. Preemby found himself the apex, so to speak, of a
triangle, the eternal triangle in an exceptionally acute
form. Whenever Meeta was on the one hand, Chris was
on the other. She called him “Our Teddy”; she pressed
upon him; she went so far as to stroke his hair. Meeta’s
endearments faded to some extent in the presence of this
competition, but she made no explicit objection.</p>

<p>Deep in the nature of the human male is a fount of polygamous
pride. Mr. Preemby in these novel circumstances
was proud and disingenuous. He believed himself “carrying
on” with two girls at once, and it seemed to him to
be a very splendid situation. But indeed it was not so
much a case of carrying on as of being carried off. In the
American world of emotional imaginations there is an ideal
called the Cave Man, much cherished by quiet, unaggressive
women because its realization would involve so little
trouble on their own part. The Cave Man is supposed to
seize and grip and carry off and adore. In this simple love
story of Mr. Preemby’s Miss Hossett played the Cave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Man’s rôle, up to the carrying-off point at any rate. On
the first occasion of their being alone together she drew
him to her and kissed him on the mouth with a warmth
and an intensity and thoroughness that astonished and
overwhelmed Mr. Preemby. It was quite different from
Meeta’s coy achievements, or anything he had ever met
around Norwich. He had not known that there was such
kissing.</p>

<p>And in the warm summer twilight Mr. Preemby found
himself being carried off to a lonely piece of beach to
Spoon with Chris Hossett. The light of a rising full moon
mingled with the afterglow; pebbles shone out like gems
and stars. He carried himself bravely but he was all
atremble. He knew that this time the enterprises would
not come from him. And the Spooning of Chris Hossett
was no more like the Spooning of Meeta than a furnace
glow is like the light of the moon.</p>

<p>“I love you,” said Chris as though that justified anything,
and as they stumbled homeward at an hour that Mr.
Preemby called “feefully late,” she said: “You’re going to
marry me aren’t you? You’ve <i>got</i> to marry me now.
And then we can <i>really</i> make love. ’Soften as we like.”</p>

<p>“I can’t rightly say that I’m exactly in a position to keep
a wife just at present,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that there’s any necessity for me to ask a
man to keep me,” said Miss Hossett. “You’re a wonder,
Teddy, anyhow, and I’m going to marry you. It’s got to be,
and there you are.”</p>

<p>“But <i>’ow</i> can I marry you?” asked Mr. Preemby almost
peevishly—for he was really very tired.</p>

<p>“One would think to hear you that no one had ever married
before,” said Chris Hossett. “And besides—after
this—you <i>must</i>.”</p>

<p>“Mind you I’ve got to go back to Norwich next Tuesday,”
said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“You ought to have thought of that before,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“But I’ll lose my situation.”</p>

<p>“Naturally father will find you something better. We
aren’t poor people, Teddy. There’s no need to be scared
about it....”</p>

<p>In such terms was Chris Hossett wooed and won by Mr.
Preemby. He was scared, dreadfully scared, but also he
was tremendously roused. It impressed him as being a
wildly romantic affair and very terrifying and a little hard
on Meeta Pinkey. But he was bustled along too fast to
think very much about Meeta Pinkey. He was introduced
over again to the Hossett parents next day as their daughter’s
affianced husband, and in secret she gave him three
golden sovereigns to buy her an engagement ring as a
surprise. Mrs. Hossett behaved at first as though she
approved of Mr. Preemby and disapproved of the marriage,
and then after what was clearly a stormy scene upstairs
with her daughter, she behaved as though she
approved highly of the marriage and thought Mr. Preemby
a very objectionable person. Mr. Hossett would not speak
to Mr. Preemby directly, but he spoke of him to his wife
and to imaginary auditors in Mr. Preemby’s presence as a
“scoundrel” who had “got hold” of his girl. Yet he, too,
seemed to regard the marriage as desirable, and no one
made any reply to his <i>obiter dicta</i>.</p>

<p>It was all very puzzling and exalting to Mr. Preemby. He
did little except what he was told to do. He was carried
over his marriage as a man might be carried over a weir.
He left any explanation to Mrs. Witcherly of what was
happening for some more favourable occasion. He went
off on Tuesday with his little valise as though he was
going back to Norwich. He wrote a simple letter of regret
to the house-agent and coal-merchant. Private affairs, he
said, of an urgent nature prevented his return to his
duties. Mrs. and Miss Hossett went up to London with
him. They all took rooms at a temperance hotel in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Bloomsbury, and Mr. Preemby was married by special
licence at St. Martin’s by Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>Then he went down to the Limpid Stream Laundry to
live with his parents-in-law and master the duties of assistant
manager, canvasser and publicity agent. Mr. Hossett
never spoke to him and sometimes talked rather unpleasantly
about him when he was in the room, making accusations
that were better ignored, but Mrs. Hossett gradually
became cordial again. And presently Mr. Hossett had a
heart seizure and died, and in the course of a few months
Mr. Preemby found himself a father. When he was first
confronted with his daughter and, as it proved, his only
child, he thought her an extremely ugly little red object.
He had never seen a baby at so early a stage before.
She had a lot of very fine moist dark hair which subsequently
gave place to a later crop; she had large indeterminate
features and remarkably large feet and hands. Mr.
Preemby had an absurd impression that he had seen her
somewhere before and hadn’t liked her. Then in a day or
so she became a quite ordinary pink baby and wonder gave
place to affection.</p>

<p>She was christened Christina Alberta after her mother
and Mr. Preemby.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>In time all these experiences mellowed in Mr. Preemby’s
memory into a vague, glorious, romantic, adventurous
past. He continued to be rather dreamy and distraught,
but on the whole he made a dutiful, faithful husband, and
he got on very well with his masterful and capable wife.</p>

<p>She was, he had discovered on his marriage, three years
his senior, and she continued to be in every respect his
senior to the day of her death. But she treated him with
proprietary affection; she chose all his clothes for him, she
cultivated his manners and bearing and upheld him against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
all other people. She dressed him rather more like a golf
champion than he would have done himself if he had had
any say in the matter. She would not let him have a
bicycle for many years, she was a little exacting about his
ways of keeping the laundry accounts, she fixed his pocket-money
at ten shillings a week, and she was disposed to
restrict his opportunities for conversation with feminine
members of the laundry staff. But he made no marked
protest against these slight deviations from the customary
obedience of a wife. A tendency to plumpness manifested
itself, and he grew considerable quantities of blonde moustache
without apparent effort.</p>

<p>Their home was an agreeable one, the more so after Mrs.
Hossett had followed her husband to his resting-place,
under a marble crucifix with a dove and olive branch in
relievo at the intersection of the arms, at Woodford Wells.
Mr. Preemby became a great reader, reading not only
romantic novels—he had a great distaste for “realism” in
any form—but ancient history, astronomy, astrology and
mystical works. He became deeply interested in the problem
of the pyramids and in the probable history of the lost
continent of Atlantis. Mental science also attracted him,
and the possibility of increasing will-power very greatly.
He would sometimes practise will-power before the looking-glass
in his bedroom when Mrs. Preemby was not
about. At nights he would sometimes will himself to sleep
instead of going to sleep in the usual fashion. He gave a
considerable amount of attention to prophecy and eschatology.
He developed views of his own about the Day of
Judgment that might have led to a breach with the Established
Church if Mrs. Preemby had not thought that such a
breach would react unfavourably upon the Laundry. As
time went on he accumulated a library of upwards of a
thousand volumes and a very considerable vocabulary.</p>

<p>His wife viewed these intellectual preoccupations with
friendly sympathy, at times even with pride, but she took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
little part in them herself. The Laundry was good enough
for her. She loved the Laundry more and more; loved its
piled clean and starched shirts and collars and its folded
and stacked sheets, loved the creak of its machinery and
the suddy bustle of the washing room. She loved to have
it all going on, orderly and right; to feel everything going
through the tubs and washers and wringers, sure and safe;
nothing astray, nothing missing at the end. When she
walked about the place voices were hushed and scrubbing
became respectfully assiduous. And she liked making
things pay.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoons and on days when the laundry had
no need of his services, Mr. Preemby took long walks. In
fine weather he would walk into Epping Forest or to Ongar
or even into the rustic peace of the Roothings, but in dull
weather he would go Londonward. After a while the
trams were extended as far as the present terminus at
Woodford and it became possible to ride very pleasantly
right into the heart of London by way of Seven Sisters
Road and Camden Town or, with a little bit of extra
walking, by the Lea Bridge Road and the Angel and
Holborn.</p>

<p>The greatness and multitudinous activities of London
stirred slumbering strands of Mr. Preemby’s imagination.
He would go in and lunch at an Aërated Bread Shop on a
scone and butter, with a cup of cocoa and perhaps a jam-puff,
and he would spend hours looking into shop windows
and sometimes even making small purchases. He loved
Charing Cross Road with its book-shops, Tottenham Court
Road, Holborn, Clerkenwell, and the Whitechapel Road,
but Piccadilly and Bond Street and Regent Street seemed
costly and lacking in true intellectual interest, and he felt
his baggy tweed knickerbockers and cap a little out of
tune in these smart places. Sometimes he would go to the
British Museum and look very hard at objects connected
with the pyramids. Great public events always drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
him to London. If there was a great murder or a great
fire or a Royal Wedding or a Royal Funeral, Mr. Preemby
would be sure to be looking at it where the crowd was
thickest, often with a neat packet of provisions, a sandwich,
an orange, or so forth, that Mrs. Preemby had provided.
But he never saw illuminations and fireworks because Mrs.
Preemby liked to have him at home when the day’s work
was over. He enjoyed the Great War of 1914-18 gravely
and profoundly. Once he passed a man who he thought
afterwards was almost certainly a German spy. The
thought thrilled him for days. He had given him a good
look anyhow. He attended air raids in plenty, and he saw
the Potters Bar Zeppelin shot down. He was a good four
years too old for compulsory military service when the
time came, and Mrs. Preemby would not let him be a special
constable because she thought he might catch cold.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby’s work in the counting house was not very
onerous, but he also gave thought and attention to the
extension of the business outside. He invented several
attractive circulars. His experience as a house-agent had
trained him to note the existence of large comfortable-looking
houses that might otherwise have escaped his
observation and to ascertain whether they were occupied;
he would then find out whether the Limpid Stream Laundry
got the washing from such establishments, and if not
he would send a circular and even follow it up with a personal
letter. He was vaguely observant about the premises.
He would go sometimes and look for quite a long time at
the furnaces or the delivery vans or any new piece of
machinery like the new calendering machine until he got
used to it. But if he stood about where there were girls
working, Mrs. Preemby would make some excuse to get
him back into the office because, as she explained, she
thought a man standing about affected the girls’ work
unfavourably. He took in and sometimes read the <i>British
Laundryman</i> and the <i>Dyers’ and Cleaners’ Gazette</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Occasionally he had happy ideas. It was his idea to paint
the delivery vans bright blue and decorate them with a
swastika, and to paint exactly the same colour and design
on the front of the laundry and put it on the bills. But
when he wanted to put the van drivers into swastika caps
and blue the clothes baskets, Mrs. Preemby said she
thought the thing had gone far enough. It was also Mr.
Preemby who suggested Ford cars instead of horse vans as
early as 1913. This change was made in 1915.</p>

<p>And at home with her peaceful interested father and her
busy, occasionally, rather astringent, mother, Christina
Alberta grew to girlhood and womanhood.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE SECOND<br>

<i>Christina Alberta</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<small>HIS</small> story, it was clearly explained in the first paragraph
of the first section of the first chapter, is a story
about Mr. Preemby in the later years, the widower years,
of his life. That statement has all the value of an ordinary
commercial guarantee, and on no account shall we ever
wander far from Mr. Preemby. But the life of his daughter
was so closely interwoven with his own during that time
that it is necessary to tell many things about her distinctly
and explicitly before we get our real story properly begun.
And even after it has begun, and while it goes on, and
right up to the end, Christina Alberta will continue to
intrude.</p>

<p>Intrusion was in her nature. She was never what is
called an engaging child. But she always had a great liking
for her Daddy and he had the greatest affection and respect
for her.</p>

<p>She had little or no tact, and there was always something
remote and detached, something of the fairy changeling
about her. Even her personal appearance was tactless.
She had a prominent nose which tended to grow larger,
whereas Mrs. Preemby’s nose was small and bright and
pinched between her glasses, and her father’s delicately
chiselled and like some brave little boat shooting a great
cascade of moustache; she was dark and both her parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
were fair. As she grew up the magic forces of adolescence
assembled her features into a handsome effect, but she was
never really pretty. Her eyes were brown and bright and
hard. She had her mother’s thin-lipped, resolute mouth
and modestly determined chin. And she had her mother’s
clear firm skin and bright colour. She was a humming,
shouting, throwing, punching child with a tendency not to
hear admonitions and an almost instinctive dexterity in
avoiding sudden slaps. She flitted about. She might be up
the drying-ground or she might be under your bed. The
only thing to do was to down and look.</p>

<p>She danced. Neither Mr. Preemby nor Mrs. Preemby
danced, and this continual jiggeting about perplexed and
worried them. A piano or a distant band would set her
dancing or she would dance to her own humming; she
danced to hymn-tunes and on a Sunday. There was a
standing offer from Mr. Preemby of sixpence if ever she
sat quiet for five minutes, but it was never taken up.</p>

<p>At her first school, a mixed day-school in Buckhurst Hill,
she was first of all extremely unpopular and then extremely
popular and then she was expelled. Afterwards she did
fairly well at the Taverners’ Girls’ School at Woodford,
where she was recognized from the first as a humorist.
There was always a difficulty in calling her any other name
than Christina Alberta. People tried all sorts of names but
none of them stuck but “Christina Alberta.” “Babs” and
“Baby” and “Bertie” and “Buss” she was called at home and
“Ally” and “Tina,” and at school they tried “Nosey” and
“Suds” and “Feet” and “Preemy” and “Prim.” Also “Golliwog”
because of her hair at hockey. These all came off
again, and left the original name exposed.</p>

<p>She was quick at her lessons and particularly at history,
geography and drawing, but disrespectful to her teachers;
at school hockey she played forward right with marked
success. She could run like the wind, and she never seemed
blown. Her pinch was simply frightful. She could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
sudden grimaces with her nose that gave the weaker sort
hysterics. She was particularly disposed to do this at
school prayers.</p>

<p>Between her mother and herself there was a streak of
animosity. It was not a very broad streak, but it was
there. Her mother seemed to cherish some incommunicable
grievance against her. It didn’t prevent Mrs. Preemby
from doing her duty by the child, but it restrained any
real warmth of affection between them. From an early age
it was Daddy got the kisses and got climbed over and
pulled about. He returned this affection. He called her
“my own little girl” and would even say at times that she
was a Wonder. He took her for walks with him and told
her many secret things that were in his mind, about the
Lost Atlantis and the Lamas of Tibet and the fundamentals
of Astrology preserved indecipherably in the proportions
of the pyramids. He’d often wished, he said, to
have a good look at the pyramids. Sometimes one man
saw things that others didn’t. She would listen intently,
although not always in quite the right spirit.</p>

<p>He would tell her of the virtue and science of Atlantis.
“They walked about in long white robes,” he said. “More
like Bible Characters than human beings.”</p>

<p>“Good for the laundries, Daddy,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“All we know of astrology is just fragments of what they
knew. They knew the past and future.”</p>

<p>“Pity they were all drowned,” she remarked without
apparent irony.</p>

<p>“Maybe they weren’t all drowned,” he said darkly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean there’s Atlantics about nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Some may have escaped. Descendants may be nearer
than you suppose. Why you and me, Christina, we may
have Atlantic blood!”</p>

<p>His manner conveyed his conviction.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to help much,” she said.</p>

<p>“Helps more than you think. Hidden gifts. Insight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Things like that. <i>We</i> aren’t common persons, Christina
Alberta.”</p>

<p>For some moments the two of them pursued independent
reveries.</p>

<p>“Still we don’t <i>know</i> we’re Atlantics,” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>After she had fought her way to the sixth form in the
Taverners’ School the educational outlook of Christina
Alberta was troubled by dissensions both within the school
and without. The staff was divided about her, her discipline
was bad, her class-work rank or vile, but she passed
examinations, and particularly external examinations by
independent examiners, with conspicuous success. There
was a general desire to get her out of the school; but
whether that was to be done by a university scholarship
or a simple request to her parents to take her away, was a
question under dispute. The games-mistress was inclined
to regard murder as a third possible course because of the
girl’s utter disregard for style in games, her unsportsmanlike
trick of winning them in irregular and unexpected
ways, and her tendency to make drill and gymnastics an
occasion for a low facetiousness far more suitable for the
ordinary class-room. The English and Literature mistress
concurred—although Christina Alberta would spend hours
over her essays working in sentences and paragraphs from
Pater and Ruskin and Hazlitt so that they might pass as
her own original constructions. It was not Christina
Alberta’s fault if ever and again these threads of literary
gold were marked in red ink, “Clumsy” or “Might be better
expressed” or “Too flowery.” Only the head-mistress had a
really good word for Christina Alberta. But then the head-mistress,
as became her position, made a specialty of
understanding difficult cases.</p>

<p>And Christina Alberta was always quietly respectful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the head-mistress, and could produce a better side to her
nature with the most disconcerting alacrity whenever the
head-mistress was called in.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta, as soon as the issue became clear to her,
decided for the scholarship. She reformed almost obtrusively,
she became tidy, she ceased to be humorous, she
lost sets of tennis to the games-mistress like a little sports-woman,
and she stopped arguing and became the sedulous
ape of Stevenson for the estranged English mistress. But
it was up-hill work even in the school. There was a little
too much elegant surrender in her reformed tennis and a
little too much parody about her English in velveteen. The
possibility that she would ever join that happy class of
girls who go in from the suburbs to classes in London and
lead the higher life beyond parental inspection and sometimes
until quite late in the evening in studios, laboratories
and college lecture-rooms, seemed a very insecure one, even
without reckoning with the quiet but determined opposition
of her mother.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Preemby was not the woman to like a daughter
educated above her parentage and station. She came to
lament her weakness in not bringing Christina Alberta
into the laundry as she herself had been brought in at the
age of fourteen. Then she would have learnt the business
from the ground up, and have qualified herself to help and
at last succeed her mother, even as Mrs. Preemby had
helped and succeeded Mrs. Hossett. But the school with
its tennis and music and French and so forth had turned
the girl against this clean and cleansing life. She was rising
seventeen now, and the sooner she abandoned these things
which lead straight to school-teaching, spinsterhood, Italian
holidays, “art” clothes and stuck-up incapacity, the better
for her and every one.</p>

<p>She made a campaign against Christina Alberta’s habit of
sitting about in unladylike attitudes and reading; and when
Mr. Preemby took the unusual and daring course of saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
that it was a bit hard on the girl, and that he didn’t see any
harm in a book or so now and then, Mrs. Preemby took him
up to Christina Alberta’s own little room to see what came
of it, and more particularly to see the sort of pictures she’d
stuck up there. Even when he was confronted with a large
photographic reproduction of Michael Angelo’s creation of
Adam as the master had painted that event on the roof of
the Sistine Chapel in Rome, he still made a feeble show
of resistance, and said that it was “Art.”</p>

<p>“You’d stand anything she did, I believe,” said Mrs.
Preemby. “Look at it. Art! Look at these books! Darwin’s
<i>Origin of Species</i>! That’s a nice book for a girl to be
prying into.”</p>

<p>“Very likely she doesn’t see the harm of it,” said Mr.
Preemby.</p>

<p>“<i>Her!</i>” said Mrs. Preemby compactly. “And look at
this!”</p>

<p>“This” was Howe’s <i>Atlas of Biology</i>. She opened it to
display its large pages crowded with pictures of the detailed
dissection of a frog.</p>

<p>“Reely, my dear!” said Mr. Preemby. “It’s one of her
schoolbooks. There reely isn’t nothing what I should call
<i>improper</i> in that. It’s Science. And, after all, it’s only a
frog.”</p>

<p>“Pretty things they teach at school nowadays. What
with your Art and your Science. Doesn’t leave much to the
imagination. Why, when I was a girl if I’d asked Ma
what was inside <i>any</i> animal, she’d have slapped me and
slapped me hard. And rightly. There’s things rightly hid
from us—and hid they ought to be. God shows us as
much as is good for us. More. No need to <i>open</i> animals.
And here—here’s a book <i>in French</i>!”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Mr. Preemby, yielding a little. He took up
the lemon-yellow volume and turned it over in his hand.</p>

<p>“All this reading!” said Mrs. Preemby and indicated three
shelves of books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Mr. Preemby assembled his courage. “You mustn’t expect
me to go against reading, Chris,” he said. “It’s a pleasure
and a light. There’s things in books.... Reely, Chris,
I believe you’d be happier if you read a bit. Christina
Alberta is a born reader, whether you like it or not. She
gets it from me, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Preemby started and regarded his flushed opposition;
the anger in her eyes was magnified through her
glasses. “It’s wonderful,” she said after a little pause; “it’s
truly wonderful how Christina Alberta manages to get
everything she wants.”</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>Miss Maltby-Neverson, the head-mistress of the Taverners’
School, called upon Mrs. Preemby and shook her
resolution a good deal. She was obviously a lady, and the
school washing ran in term-time to twenty pounds a week.
She was taken to see the scandalous picture and she said:
“Very beautiful, I’m sure. One of the really Great Paintings
in the world. Pro-foundly religious. It’s the very
words of the Bible made into a picture. What do you find
in it to object to, Mrs. Preemby?”</p>

<p>Whereupon, as if by a trick, the picture ceased to be
scandalous and Mrs. Preemby was ashamed of herself. She
saw now there never had been anything wrong about that
picture.</p>

<p>Miss Maltby-Neverson said that Christina Alberta was
a difficult type but a thoroughly interesting personality,
a <i>real</i> personality. She had a great capacity for affection.</p>

<p>“I haven’t found that,” said Mrs. Preemby.</p>

<p>“It is a type I have studied,” said Miss Maltby-Neverson,
simply but conclusively.</p>

<p>She explained that Christina Alberta was an <i>active</i> type.
Left to herself without employment to <i>stretch</i> her faculties
she might easily get into almost any sort of mischief.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Almost any sort. Not that there was anything wrong in
her essentially. It was just energy. Given good hard
work and a scope for ambition, she might become a very
satisfactory woman indeed—possibly even a distinguished
woman.</p>

<p>“I’ve no use for distinguished women,” said Mrs. Preemby
shortly.</p>

<p>“The world has,” said Miss Maltby-Neverson gently.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m one of the old-fashioned sort,” said Mrs.
Preemby.</p>

<p>“Christina Alberta isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Let the man be distinguished abroad and the woman distinguished
at home,” said Mrs. Preemby. “I’m sorry to
differ from you, Miss Maltby-Neverson, but one cannot
help one’s opinions.”</p>

<p>“It depends upon ourselves,” said Miss Maltby-Neverson.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I like men to rule,” said Mrs. Preemby.
“Woman has her place in the world, and it isn’t man’s.”</p>

<p>“But I thought Mr. Preemby rather favoured the scholarship
idea.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Preemby was baffled. “He <i>did</i>,” she said as though
she did not see clearly what that had to do with the matter.
“Give the thing a trial,” said Miss Maltby-Neverson.
“After all, she may not win this scholarship.”</p>

<p>But Christina Alberta won it with marks to spare. She
took no risks. It was a biennial scholarship which had
been established by a benefactor of advanced views. It
was tenable at the London School of Economics. As soon
as Christina Alberta knew she had secured it she went,
without consulting her mother or anyone, to a hairdresser’s
and had her hair bobbed. To Mrs. Preemby this was
almost a worse blow than the scholarship. She surveyed
her shock-headed, handsome-nosed daughter in her short
gymnastic skirts with a qualm of sincere hatred.</p>

<p>She wished she could make her daughter feel about herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
as she felt about her. “I wish you could only see yourself,”
she said with concentrated bitterness.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>I</i> know,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re a judgment on me,” said Mrs. Preemby.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>But Christina Alberta had only studied in the London
School of Economics for a year, she was beginning her
second year when her mother obliged her to resign her
scholarship. Christina Alberta had stayed late in London
one evening without telling her mother she was going to
do so, she had gone to a discussion of the Population
Question at the New Hope Club in Fitzgerald Street, and
she had come home smelling so strongly of tobacco that
her mother had repented of and revoked all her concessions
to modernity there and then.</p>

<p>She had been waiting for that moment for many months.
“This ends it,” she said as she let her daughter in.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta found there was no immediate way
round or through that decision. She worked her father
and Miss Maltby-Neverson in vain. But instead of resigning
her scholarship right out as she had been told to do,
she played for time and explained her absence by a vague
reference to family trouble.</p>

<p>Mrs. Preemby in those days was already in very bad
health, but this fact was completely overshadowed in the
minds of both her daughter and her husband by the far
more urgent fact that she was now constantly in a very bad
temper. Everything was conspiring to worry her—except
Mr. Preemby, who knew better than to do anything of the
sort.</p>

<p>The closing years of the Great War, and still more so the
opening year of the Disappointing Peace, were years of very
great difficulty for the laundry business. The munitions
business put laundry girls above themselves and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
no doing anything with them. Coal, soap, everything was
at unheard-of prices, and it was impossible to get back on
the customers by raising the charges. People, even the
best sort of people, were giving up cleanliness. Gentlemen
of position would wear their dress-shirts three or four
times and make their undervests and under-pants last a
fortnight. Household linen was correspondingly eked out.
People moved about; the new army officers’ wives came
and went, here to-day and gone to-morrow, leaving unpaid
bills. Never had Mrs. Preemby known so many bad debts.
Van men came back from the army so shell-shocked and
militarized that they embezzled out of pure nervousness
and habit. Income tax became a nightmare. Outside as
within, Mrs. Preemby’s life was a conflict. She kept the
Limpid Stream Laundry paying all through that awful
time because she was a wonder at management, but she
did it at a terrible loss of vitality.</p>

<p>She became bitterly critical of the unhelpfulness of Mr.
Preemby and her daughter. When they tried to be helpful
she criticized their incapacity. They did more harm than
good.</p>

<p>Meal-times were awful. She would sit flushed and glowering
through her glasses, obviously afflicted by a passionate
realization of the world’s injustice and eating very little.
Mr. Preemby’s attempts to start a cheerful conversation
were rarely successful. Even Christina Alberta was
overawed.</p>

<p>“Things going a little better this morning?” Mr. Preemby
would try.</p>

<p>“Can’t I get rest from business even at my meals?”
the poor lady would complain.</p>

<p>Or, “Looks like pleasant weather for the Derby.”</p>

<p>“Pity you can’t go there for all the help you are in the
place. I suppose you haven’t heard what’s happened to
van number two.”</p>

<p>“No!” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“You wouldn’t. Hind mudguard smashed. Been done for
weeks. And nobody knows who did it. One would think
that that was a man’s business anyhow. But it’s left for me
to find out. And pay for. Like everything else in the
place.”</p>

<p>“I’d better make inquiries.”</p>

<p>“I know those inquiries of yours. Better leave the whole
thing alone now. Grin and bear it....”</p>

<p>The silence of the meal would be restored.</p>

<p>She seemed to set a high value upon these awful silences.
She even complained that he ate his cheese biscuits audibly.
But how else can one eat cheese biscuits? Christina Alberta
was made of sterner stuff and became controversial. Then
her mother would flare out at her insolence and declare
that “one or the other of us” leaves the table. “I’ll read
upstairs,” said Christina Albert. “It isn’t <i>my</i> wish to be
lunching here.”</p>

<p>Before the abrupt ending of Christina Alberta’s university
career she was present only at breakfast and supper;
supper wasn’t nearly as awful in quality as breakfast, and
breakfast could easily be bolted and got away from; but
after the New Hope Club catastrophe, she was present at
all the meals, a sort of lightning-conductor for her father
and something of a restraint upon, and an added exasperation
to, her mother. She took the line of agreeing that if
her university career was to end, then she must go into the
laundry business; but she argued very stoutly that to do
that with any hope of success under modern conditions
meant a “proper business training.” If she could not go to
the London School of Economics then she ought to go to
Tomlinson’s Commercial Training School in Chancery Lane
and learn book-keeping, shorthand, typing, business correspondence,
précis, commercial French, and so forth. And
after three weeks of painful midday meals this proposal was
adopted under stringent conditions and her season-ticket
to London was renewed. She worked her way very passably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
through another winter with Tomlinson’s as her school
and most of London as her playground. She learnt all
sorts of things. She added a new set of friends and
acquaintances, some with bobbed hair and some without,
of the most various social origins and associations, to the
circle she had already acquired at the London School of
Economics.</p>

<p>When presently Mrs. Preemby began to speak of a gnawing
pain that oppressed her, both her husband and daughter
took it at first as a new development of her general grievance
against them and felt no particular apprehension about
it. Mr. Preemby said he thought she ought to take advice
or see some one about it, but for some days she treated
the suggestion with scorn. If once she got in a doctor,
she said, they’d have to find some one else to look after
the laundry. Doctors put you to bed and give you things
to keep you there. Otherwise how could they get a living?</p>

<p>Then suddenly she changed. One morning she confessed
she felt “dreadful.” She went back to bed and Mr. Preemby,
with strange premonitions that the world was coming to
an end, trotted off for a doctor. The clinical thermometer
showed a temperature mounting above one hundred and
one. “It hurts. My side hurts,” said Mrs. Preemby. “I’ve
had it once before, but not like this.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta came home that evening to discover
herself capable of fear, remorse, and tenderness.</p>

<p>She had some strange moments with her mother in
between phases of weak delirium and insensibility. Mrs.
Preemby’s face seemed to have become smaller and prettier;
the feverish flush in her cheeks simulated youth. She
was no longer hard or angry, but rather pathetically
friendly. And Christina Alberta hadn’t seen her in bed for
years.</p>

<p>“Take care of your Daddy,” said Mrs. Preemby. “You
owe more to him—and less to him—than you think. I had
to do all I’ve done. Take care of him. He’s gentle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
good and easily persuaded and not to be trusted alone in
the world....</p>

<p>“I’ve never been quite all a mother should be to you.
But you’ve been <i>difficult</i>, Christina.... I’ve had a great
respect for you....</p>

<p>“I’m glad you haven’t my eyes. Glasses are a
Curse....”</p>

<p>Anxiety about the laundry occupied a large part of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“That woman Smithers in the washing room is a thief,
and I’d get rid of the new man Baxandale. I don’t know
why I’ve kept Mrs. Smithers on so long.... Weakness.... I’m
not sure about <i>him</i>, there’s nothing positive
yet, but I feel he’s not straight.... I’m very much
afraid we’ve let Lady Badger’s account run too long. Nowadays
titles—want watching. I’ve been misled by her. She
promised a cheque.... But I doubt about you two in the
laundry altogether. He can’t and you won’t. <i>You</i> might
have done it.... Never mind that now.</p>

<p>“Sell it as a going concern? The Widgerys might come in.
He’s hard, but he’s straight. Straight enough. They might
like to come in....</p>

<p>“It’s never entered my head I wasn’t good for twenty
years yet.... I wish the doctor wouldn’t think of operating.
It won’t do any good.”</p>

<p>She repeated many of her phrases.</p>

<p>“I hate the thought of being opened,” she said. “I suppose—.
Like those frogs in your book....</p>

<p>“Packed like a bag.... Never get it back again.
Loose bits....</p>

<p>“Washing-basket or something to keep it together.”</p>

<p>Then her mind went off at a tangent to things beyond
Christina Alberta’s understanding.</p>

<p>“Sneaked off and left me to it.... I wonder what he’s
doing now.... Suppose.... Fancy, if it should be him
that had to operate.... Operate....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Children we were.”</p>

<p>She seemed to recollect herself and regarded her daughter
with a hard inquiring eye. Some instinct in Christina
Alberta told her to assume an incurious expression. But
these words struck upon her mind and stayed there and
germinated like a seed. Children they were, and he had
sneaked off? Queer and yet according with all sorts of
other imponderables.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Mr. Preemby looked unusually small but unusually dignified
in his full mourning. Christina Alberta was also
extremely black and shiny. Her skirts reached for the first
time in her life to her ankles; a sacrifice that she felt would
be particularly acceptable to the spirit of the departed.</p>

<p>A new thing had come into Christina Alberta’s life—responsibility.
She perceived that for unfathomable reasons
she was responsible for Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>It was clear that the sudden death of his wife under the
surgeon’s knife had been a very great blow to him. He
did not break down or weep or give way to paroxysms of
grief, but he was enormously still and sad. His round
china-blue eyes and his moustache looked at the world
with a mournful solemnity. The undertaker had rarely met
so satisfactory a widower. “Everything of the best,” said
Mr. Preemby. “Whatever she can have, she must have.”
Under the circumstances, the undertaker, who was a friend
of the family, having met both Mr. and Mrs. Preemby
at whist-drives quite frequently, showed commendable
moderation.</p>

<p>“You can’t imagine what all this means to me,” said Mr.
Preemby to Christina Alberta, quite a number of times.
“It was a pure love match,” he said; “pure romance. She
had nothing to gain by marrying me. But neither of us
thought of sordid things.” He was silent for a little while,
struggling with intractable memories. He subdued them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
“We just met,” he said, smiling faintly; “and it seemed that
it <i>had</i> to be.”</p>

<p>“Sneaked off and left me”; came a faint whisper in
Christina Alberta’s memory.</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>There was much to see to in those days of mourning.
Christina Alberta did her best to help, watch and guide
Mr. Preemby even as her mother had desired, but she was
surprised to find in him certain entirely unexpected decisions
that had apparently leapt into existence within a few
hours of her mother’s death. One was a clear resolve that
he and she must part company with the laundry either by
selling it or letting it, or, if no means of disposing of it
offered, by burning it down or blowing it up as speedily
as possible. He did not discuss this; he treated it as an
unavoidable necessity. He expressed no animosity for the
laundry, he made no hostile criticism of the life he had led
there, but every thought betrayed his fundamental aversion.
And also they were to go away—right away—from
Woodford Wells and never return thither. She had come to
much the same decisions on her own account, but she had
not expected to find them in such quiet strength in him.</p>

<p>He became explicit about the future as they sat at supper
on the evening of the funeral.</p>

<p>“Your mother’s cousin, Sam Widgery,” he said, “was talking
to me.”</p>

<p>He munched for a moment; his moustache went up and
down and his eyes of china-blue stared out of the window
at the sunset sky. “He wants to take it over.”</p>

<p>“The laundry?”</p>

<p>“As a going concern. And he being our nearest relation,
so to speak, I’d as soon he had it as anybody else. Other
things being equal.... Wish I knew what to ask him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
it. I don’t want to ask him too little. So I said I didn’t
care to discuss things at a funeral. Said he’d better come
along to-morrow. Their place isn’t doing well. It’s got
sort of embedded in Walthamstow. It would pay him to
get out and let the land go for building. He hasn’t got very
much money.... But he wants this place. He reely
wants this place.”</p>

<p>His blue eyes were the eyes of one who sees visions.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if they taught you about making companies
at the School of Economics. I’m a child at all that sort of
thing. He talks about partnership or a mortgage or something
like that, but what we want—what we want is a
limited company. And what we want is something like
debentures only rather more like preference shares. We
want it so that whatever he draws out of the business we’ve
got to draw out more. Otherwise the company can cut
away the security for your debentures by paying too much
dividend on the ordinary shares. <i>He</i>’ll have the ordinary
shares. Him and his wife. I don’t say he’d do such a thing
deliberately, but he might very easily be led into doing it.
He’s got to be looked after. We want to fix it so that if he
pays more on his shares than we get on our shares we’d get
our interest levelled up. It’s all very difficult and complicated,
Christina Alberta.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta regarded Mr. Preemby with a new and
deepening respect. She had never heard him make such a
speech before at meals, but then he had never before been
free from interruption and correction.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to have it fixed up properly by our solicitors,”
said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“We shan’t be badly off,” he continued, helping himself to
cheese.</p>

<p>“There’s a mortgage or so we’ve got and some houses at
Buckhurst Hill. It’s a curious thing, but your poor dear
mother had a sort of faith in my eye for house property.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
She often let me guide her. And I always had a feeling for
making some sort of reserve <i>out</i> of the business.... Very
likely Sam Widgery will take over most of the furniture of
this house. It’s a bigger house than his....”</p>

<p>“Where do you think of going to live, Daddy?” asked
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“I don’t rightly know,” said Mr. Preemby after a moment
or so of introspection. “I keep thinking of different places.”</p>

<p>“London,” she said. “If I could go back to study—before
it is too late.”</p>

<p>“London,” he said, “it might be.”</p>

<p>He hesitated over his next suggestion with the hesitation
that had become a habit, so accustomed was he to see his
suggestions crumpled up and flung aside. “Have you ever
heard of Boarding Houses, Christina Alberta?” he asked
with an unreal carelessness. “Have you ever thought it
might be possible for us to go and live in Boarding
Houses?”</p>

<p>“In London?”</p>

<p>“All over the world—almost, there are Boarding Houses.
You see, Christina Alberta, we might get rid of our furniture
here, except for my books and a few little things, and
we might put most of that away for a time—Taylor’s
Repository would take care of that for us—and we might
go and live sometimes in a Boarding House here, and
sometimes in a Boarding House there. Then you could
study and needn’t keep house, and I could read and look
at things and make memorandums about some Theories
I’ve thought of, and talk to people and hear people talking.
All sorts of people go to Boarding Houses—all sorts of
interesting people. These last nights I’ve been thinking no
end about living in Boarding Houses. I keep on thinking
of it, turning it over in my mind. It would be a new life
for me—like beginning again. Life’s been so regular here.
All very well while your poor dear mother was alive, but
now I feel I want distraction. I want to move about and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
see all sorts of things and different kinds of people. I want
to forget. Why, in some of these Boarding Houses there’s
Chinese and Indians and Russian princesses, and professors
and actors and all sorts of people. Just to hear
them!”</p>

<p>“There’s Boarding Houses full of students in Bloomsbury.”</p>

<p>“Every sort,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“One place that attracts me,” said Mr. Preemby, pouring
out what remained of the beer, “is Tumbridge Wells.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that sometimes called Tunbridge, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Formerly. But now it is always spoken of as Tumbridge
Wells. At this Tumbridge Wells, Christina Alberta, there
are hills with names that point directly to some connection
with the ancient Israelites, Mount Ephraim and Mount
Gilboa and so on, and there are a number of curiously
shaped rocks, shaped in the likeness of great toads and
prehistoric monsters and mystical forms and nobody knows
whether they are the work of God’s hand or man’s. I am
very anxious to see these things for myself. They may
have a deeper and closer significance for us than is commonly
supposed. There are plenty of Boarding Houses at
Tumbridge Wells—I was told only the other day by a man
I met in the Assyrian room in the British Museum—and
some of them are said to be very comfortable and reasonable
indeed.”</p>

<p>“We might go there for the holidays,” said Christina
Alberta, “before the London session begins.”</p>

<p>Outside was the summer afterglow, and a dusky peace
filled the room. Father and daughter followed divergent
trains of thought. Mr. Preemby was the first to break the
silence.</p>

<p>“Now that I shall be in mourning, or half mourning, for
some time I have decided to give away all those Harris
tweed knickerbocker suits and stockings of mine. Some
poor man might feel the comfort of them—in winter. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
have never really liked those <i>very</i> baggy knickerbockers,
but of course while your poor dear mother was alive her
taste was Law to me. And those caps; they get over your
eyes when you’re hot. That tweed stuff.... It is overrated.
When you ride a bicycle or anything it ravels out
with the friction of the seat. Makes you look ridiculous....
And I think that quite soon I shall get myself one of
those soft grey felt hats—with a black band.”</p>

<p>“I have always wanted to see you wear one, Daddy,” said
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“It would count as mourning?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, Daddy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby meditated pleasantly. The girl had common
sense. Her advice was worth having. “As for putting
the swastika on your poor dear mother’s tombstone, perhaps
you are right in thinking it is not what she herself would
have chosen. It may be better after all to do as you
suggest and erect a simple cross. After all—it is <i>her</i>
tombstone.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Christina Alberta got up from her chair and
went round the table—almost at a prance, until she remembered
things—and kissed him. For some obscure reason
she hated the swastika almost as much as she loved her
Daddy. For her it had become the symbol of silliness, and
she did not like to think of him as silly. Particularly now
when for some obscure reason she was beginning to think
of him as ill-used.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>There was much to see to before the Preembys could go
to Tunbridge Wells. There had to be quite a number of
interviews with Mr. Sam Widgery at Woodford Wells
and afterwards in the dingy offices of Messrs. Payne and
Punter in Lincoln’s Inn. It was clear from the first to these
men of affairs that Mr. Preemby was a child at business,
but as they went on with him they realized that he was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
extremely greedy and intractable child. It was six weeks
before Mr. and Mrs. Sam Widgery could move in, sullenly
and resentfully, to the Limpid Stream premises, and Mr.
Preemby and his daughter could go on after a day or so
in London to select a Boarding House at Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta spent her early days as an orphan
struggling against an unreasonable cheerfulness and a profound
sense of release. She found her father ready to
accept almost any explanation of her need to run up to
London for a day and even disposed to be tolerant when
she came home late. She had quite a little world of
miscellaneous acquaintances in London; fellow-students and
their friends, fellow-students from the London School of
Economics and fellow-students at Tomlinson’s School and
art students they knew and medical students they knew
and girls from the provinces who had chucked their families
and got typing jobs, and so on to models and chorus girls
and vaguely employed rather older young men of the intellectual
class. She met them in and about the class-rooms
and in A.B.C.’s and suchlike places and in the New Hope
Club, where there were even Labour politicians and men
who claimed to be Bolsheviks, and she went to parties and
duologues in studios in high, remote, extraordinary flats.
It was tremendous fun, although a lot of it had to be
snatched from the insistent claims and inquiries of Woodford
Wells. And people liked her, they liked Christina
Alberta, laughed at her jokes they did and admired her
thundering cheek and never said anything about her nose.
It was much more her natural world than the Taverners’
School people had ever been. Nobody seemed to mind
that she came out of a laundry; for all they seemed to
care about that sort of thing, she might have come out of
a gaol. In between the excitements of student life she
even did some reading.</p>

<p>In her first grief for her mother she tried not to feel a
sense of new unstinted freedom in regard to all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
adventures and experiences. Her Daddy in his grief, bless
him! was smoking much more than he had ever done
before; he was even trying cigars; he had no nose for
tobacco reek in his daughter—or for anything of that sort.
He asked few questions and they were easily answered.
Long years of exercise had made him almost constitutionally
acquiescent. Christina Alberta realized that within
very wide limits indeed now she might do anything she
pleased whenever she liked. She realized also that there
was no particular hurry to do anything at all. All the
others seemed to be running about in pairs like knives and
forks. It suited her humour to stay detached.</p>

<p>And the world had altered. This break-up of the old
home, the death of her mother, the disappearance of every
control, except her credulous, inattentive Daddy, had jerked
her forward from childhood to maturity. Hitherto home
had seemed an eternal, indestructible thing, from which
you started out for adventures, to which, whatever happened,
you returned like a sea-rover to rest and where
you went to bed and slept as you had been wont to sleep,
secure, unthreatened. Now here the two of them, Daddy
and herself, were in the open; no bolting place at all for
them; anything might happen to them and might insist
upon going on happening. She could now do just anything
she pleased, it was true, but also she realized that now she
had to take the unlimited consequences.</p>

<p>So that in spite of her sense of novel, unbounded freedoms,
Christina Alberta found she did not go up to London
any more than she would have done during her mother’s
lifetime. Many of her most attractive friends, it is true,
were away upon their holidays. And she found her father’s
company unusually interesting. Every time she came back
to him he seemed to be slightly enlarged and of a firmer
colour and consistency. He reminded her of Practical
Biology (Botanical Section) in the Taverners’ School, when
you take a dried-up bean out of its package and put it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
a jar with water and observe it under the influence of
warmth and moisture. It germinates. And he was
germinating.</p>

<p>Mother had kept him dried up for nearly twenty years,
but now he was germinating and nobody could tell what
sort of thing he might become.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE THIRD<br>

<i>In Lonsdale Mews</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">A<small>FTER</small> a month of deep mourning, Christina Alberta
put aside her long skirts and returned to the more
kilt-like garments to which she was accustomed. She had
not been inactive while her father had conducted his business
settlement with Mr. Sam Widgery, and she had
worked out a scheme of living that seemed to promise quite
a happy life for her father and herself. She fell in with
the Boarding House idea and with the project of beginning
at Tunbridge Wells. She ceased to struggle with the fact
that he continued to call it quietly but insistently <i>Tum</i>bridge
Wells; it seemed to her upon reflection that
<i>Tum</i>bridge was really the place he, at any rate, was going
to live at. That gentle departure from exactitude was
quite of a piece with his general habit of living a little
askew from actual things.</p>

<p>But she impressed upon him the view that since their
lives were to be migratory henceforth, and since there were
a certain number of books, unsaleable articles of furniture
that Mrs. Widgery would not take over at a valuation, a
number of curiosities—for example, a piece of shell which
he believed to be a fragment of a Great Auk’s Egg, a Rosicrucian
regalia, and a mummified hawk from Egypt which
had prophetic qualities, to consider—there must be a sort
of permanent headquarters in London, at which these
objects could be stored and to which he and she could
return from the various Boarding Houses round and about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the earth. And, pursuant to this suggestion, she made
inquiries and worked out an admirable project for sharing
some accommodation with two little friends of hers who
practised art, literature, and picturesque economies in a
converted mews in Chelsea. In fact, she made arrangements
with them. She told Mr. Preemby she had made
these arrangements according to his instructions, and after
a time it did come to seem to him that he had given her the
instructions upon which she acted.</p>

<p>Lonsdale Mews opens out of Lonsdale Road, Chelsea;
and there is quite a noble entrance with large stucco
pillars on either side and an arch over, on which is a design
in relievo of Neptune and sea-horses and the words “Lonsdale
Mews.” Inside there had once been stables and coach-houses,
and over each a bedroom and a sitting-room, which
was also, in the more prolific past, generally used as a
bedroom, and a cupboard and a landing and so forth, the
little home of the coachman (and his wife and family)
attached to the genteel carriage and horses below. But the
advancement of science and the progress of invention have
abolished gentility, and so reduced the number of coachmen
and carriages in the world that Lonsdale Mews has
had to accept other tenants; and being too narrow down
the centre for the coming and going of automobiles without
a great deal of bashing of mudguards and radiators,
has had to paint itself up attractively and fall back upon
art and the intelligenzia.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta’s two young friends were in possession
of one of these perverted coachmen’s homes, and as they
were very inadequately prepared to pay the rent—it was
a quite aristocratic rent—they were extremely glad to
welcome Mr. Preemby and particularly Christina Alberta
as co-tenants. Mr. Preemby was to have the big room
downstairs and there he was to arrange his books and his
surplus furnishings and ornaments and curious objects, and
have a sofa that could be made into an apparent bed when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
he wanted to sleep in London. And Christina Alberta was
to have a little bedroom for herself behind this wherein a
breezy decorative scheme of orange and bright blue more
than made up for a certain absence of daylight and fresh
air. But when the two young friends had a party or
when Mr. Preemby was away they were to have the
use of the big downstairs room, and in the case of a
party Christina Alberta’s room was to be a ladies’
cloak-room.</p>

<p>The lessors were to retain the use of the upstairs rooms
and in the matter of the kitchen all things therein were to
be held in common. None of this agreement was put into
writing and many issues were left over frankly for future
controversy. “We are to be the pigs that pay the rent,”
said Christina Alberta; that was the general idea. “Much
we’ll work out,” said Mr. Harold Crumb. “Much will
work itself out. It’s no good being too definite.” What
was definite was that Mr. Preemby was to pay the rent.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Crumb was a red-haired young man, a
shock-headed young man with a rampant profile, dressed
in a blue overall, frayed grey trousers and slippers. He had
large freckled hands and he did Black and White, which
Mr. Preemby had supposed to be a whisky but discovered
was an art. Harold lived by attempting to sell drawings
for advertisements and pictured jokes for the weekly papers.
His expression was lofty and his voice constrained and it
seemed to Mr. Preemby that he was suffered rather than
met by Mr. Crumb. With Christina Alberta Mr. Crumb
seemed to be on terms of tacit friendship and no word
passed between them. He lifted his hand and twiddled his
fingers at her—with a kind of melancholy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crumb was more effusive. She embraced Christina
Alberta warmly and answered to the name of “Fay.” Then
she turned to Mr. Preemby and shook hands with him
quite normally. She was a slender young lady with carelessly
bobbed corn-coloured hair, pale-grey eyes and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
absent-minded face. She also was dressed in a blue overall,
she wore oyster-coloured stockings and slippers and possibly
other things, and her business in life, Mr. Preemby learnt,
was to review books for various newspapers and write
romantic fiction for bookstall magazines. Her right forefinger
had that indelible inkiness which only the habitual
use of an incontinent fountain-pen can give. There was
a big screen in the downstairs room Mr. Preemby was to
have that Mr. Crumb had made and Mrs. Crumb had
covered with the bright mendacious wrappers of the books
she had reviewed. This exercised Mr. Preemby the more
because several of the wrappers were manifestly upside
down, and he could not understand whether this was due
to art, carelessness or some serious mental lapse.</p>

<p>“We’ll have something to eat,” she told Mr. Preemby,
and then they could settle up things. But she had a surprisingly
rapid articulation and it sounded like, “We’ll ’f
sum t’eat ’n’ then we’ll set lup thins.” It took ten or twelve
seconds to come through to Mr. Preemby’s understanding.
Meanwhile she had turned to Christina Alberta. “’Dabit
’f work to do,” she explained. “Bres no’ clear’ d’way. Late
las’ ni’. You be’r loo’ roun’ he’ while Nolly gessomeat an’
Ikn do ’p stairs fore you see’t.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” said Christina Alberta, understanding perfectly.
Mr. Preemby was left stunned, with his lips moving
slowly. “So long,” said Harold, and took some money out
of a black Wedgwood tea-pot and went and fell over things
in the passage, and presently went out into the wide world
while Fay vanished upstairs.</p>

<p>“She’s gone upstairs,” said Mr. Preemby, interpreting
slowly, “to do their rooms. And <i>he’s</i> gone to get some
meat. It’s a nice large room, Christina Alberta—and quite
well lit. Quite.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been in a Mew before,” said Mr.
Preemby, approaching a group of attractive drawings on
the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“In a <i>what</i>, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“In a Mew. Or in a <i>Studjo</i>.... I suppose these are
Originals.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta awaited his reaction to the drawings
with a slight anxiety.</p>

<p>“Looks like a lot of fruit and human legs and things,”
said Mr. Preemby. “Wonder what they mean? <i>Summer
Night</i> it says, and that’s <i>Passion in Solitude</i>. Don’t quite
see it, but I suppose it’s symbolical or something.” He
turned his round blue eyes to the room generally. “I could
get a mahogany cabinet for my Curiosities and have it
against the wall <i>there</i>—I’d like the sort with glass doors
so that people could see the things—and if there was some
shelves put across that place, it would hold most of my
books. There’ll have to be a bed somewhere, Christina
Alberta.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got a sofa upstairs,” said Christina Alberta,
“with an end that pulls down.”</p>

<p>“Might go there.”</p>

<p>“Or under the window.”</p>

<p>“Of course there’s my clothes,” said Mr. Preemby. “I
almost wish I hadn’t practically promised Sam Widgery
your mother’s wardrobe. Rosewood it is. It has a lot of
room in it and it might have gone against that bit of wall
there. The trunk will make a sort of seat if we get the
corners mended. Wonder how that screen would look the
other way up. Books might go behind it. These easels
and things I suppose they’ll take upstairs.... We’ll get
things settled all right.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta turned about with arms akimbo to
follow his proposals. She perceived that they threatened a
considerable disturbance of the æsthetic balance of the
studio. She’d just thought of a little bed-sofa affair with a
bright rug over it. Silly of her to forget the baggage. But
in the end perhaps it might be possible to arrest a lot of his
gear in the passage. The passage was so choked already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
that a little more in it hardly seemed to matter. He could
go out and get what things he wanted when he wanted
them. She had a momentary anticipation of him in his
shirt and braces, routing in trunks.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mr. Preemby, “when you said you’d got
two little friends in a <i>Studjo</i>, I thought they were two
girls. I didn’t think they were a married couple.”</p>

<p>“They aren’t so <i>fearfully</i> married,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Preemby, and was restrained by modesty
from further speech for some seconds. “Of course,” he
said, “if presently a Family came along—well, we’d have
to move out, Christina Alberta.”</p>

<p>“Never meet families half-way,” said Christina Alberta.
“It isn’t very likely anyhow. You trust Fay.”</p>

<p>“You never know,” said Mr. Preemby rather weakly, and
showed a tendency to drift back to those ambiguous
drawings.</p>

<p>“About time we had a look at the upstairs rooms, Daddy,”
said Christina Alberta, and went out into the passage to
call “Fay!”</p>

<p>The answer came remotely. “Lo?”</p>

<p>“Read-<i>dee</i>?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta found her Daddy back in the illustrated
corner with his head on one side like an inquiring sparrow.
For some time nothing was said. “Of course,” he remarked
at last; “it’s Art.” He turned away with his face pursed
up beneath the moustache, humming faintly. She perceived
it was just as much Art as he could stand.</p>

<p>He ran his hand over the wall and turned intelligent eyes
to Christina Alberta. “It’s just canvas,” he said; “what
you pack things in. With sort of dabs of gold paint. I
don’t think I’ve ever seen walls that wasn’t either done with
paper or distemper before. I suppose really one might
put all sorts of things on walls, cloth, bed-ticking, tarpaulin.
Odd how one doesn’t think of things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>Presently “upstairs” was “read-ee;” Mrs. Harold Crumb
was free to answer questions and make explanations and
Mr. Preemby could learn more of Christina Alberta’s
plans for his comfort. Upstairs was more various but less
spacious than downstairs, the beds were dressed-up rather
than disguised as divans and there was more vaguely
improper but highly decorative Art. Like Christina Alberta
Mrs. Crumb had not fully considered Mr. Preemby’s possibilities
in the way of luggage, but she rose to the occasion
very well. When Mr. Preemby spoke of the mahogany
cabinet and the wardrobe, she said that it would be quite
easy for Harold to “camouflage” them with very, very
bright-coloured paint, and she thought a lot might be done
for Mr. Preemby’s trunks and clothes by making a curtained
alcove in a corner. “Trouble with clothes,” said Mrs.
Crumb, “is when somebody starts charades or dressing up.
Nothing is sacred. Last week, somebody tore my only
pyjamas limb from limb.”</p>

<p>“We’d have to arrange,” said Mr. Preemby, a little
uneasily.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to arrange somehow,” said Mrs. Crumb.</p>

<p>But before anything could be arranged definitely Harold
returned from his shopping with a large piece of purple
beefsteak in a mere loin cloth of newspaper, and a lettuce
and a bundle of small onions in his hand and two large
bottles of beer under his arm, and everybody’s attention
was directed to the preparation of the midday meal.</p>

<p>“Generally,” said Harold, “we go Out for a meal. There’s
quite a decent aufschnittery and a little Italian place and
so forth not five minutes away in the King’s Road. It’s
more fun feeding Out. But we thought you’d like to see
the studio put through its paces.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby in the course of his life had rarely seen
meals prepared; somebody else had always laid a table and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
said “Dinner’s ready, Daddy,” or “Supper’s ready, Daddy,”
as the case might be, and he had just sat down, and it was
with real interest that he obeyed Mr. Crumb’s invitation
to “come and see how we do it,” and assisted under direction
in the operations. Mr. Crumb, in a few well-chosen
words, introduced the cooking apparatus that clustered
around the gas-stove; the gas-stove was lit explosively, Mr.
Preemby handed things and held things under direction and
got in the way a good deal. Christina Alberta, who
seemed used to the job, chopped the onions and dressed a
salad at a small kitchen table close at hand, and the steak
got itself grilled fiercely and flaringly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Crumb laid a blue-painted table in what
was to be Mr. Preemby’s room with an orange-coloured
cloth and a selection of plates and parts of plates, yellow-glazed
mugs with rudely painted inscriptions in some rustic
dialect, “Here’s t’ absent frens” and the like, several knives
and forks, a pewter mug full of cigarettes and a bunch of
sunflowers in a brown-glazed bowl. And at this table Mr.
Preemby presently found himself seated very hot in the
face and liberally splashed with fat from the grilled steak.
Nobody said grace, and the meal began.</p>

<p>There was a general assumption that Mr. Preemby’s
tenancy was settled, though there were many points upon
which he would have liked a clearer definition. He was
particularly anxious to exclude as tactfully as possible his
garments and his specimens from promiscuous use as properties
when these charades occurred, but he did not know
quite how to reopen the subject. And he was preoccupied
by a doubt whether his long nightgowns of Saxony flannel,
if they were publicly exposed, might not be considered
old-fashioned by these artistic young people. But their
talk jumped about so that it was difficult to lead up to what
he had to say. He was accustomed, especially when company
was present, to clear his throat “h’rrmp” and waggle
his moustache up and down a little before he spoke, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
by the time he was ready to deliver what he had to say
one of the others was away with something else. So that
he hardly said anything but an occasional “h’rrmp” all
through the meal.</p>

<p>The two young ladies did most of the talking. Harold
seemed moody, making an occasional correction or comment
upon his wife’s remarks and eating most of the steak
with the pained expression of one who has tender teeth
and is used to better food. Once he asked Mr. Preemby if
he really cared for Good Music, and once if he had been to
see the Iberian dancers last year, but neither of these
inquiries led to a sustained conversation. “H’rrmp. No-oh,”
said Mr. Preemby. “Not exactly. Not particularly,”
and in the second case, “No-oh, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Crumb talked brightly of various newspaper jobs
she had got and how she had been asked to do a children’s
corner in the <i>Patriotic News</i> and whether she would accept
the offer—Mr. Preemby thought the editors and newspaper
proprietors she mentioned seemed a depraved lot—but
mainly the talk concerned the movements and readjustments
of a large circle of friends. After the meal there
was coffee, and Harold, with an air of resignation, went
and washed up.</p>

<p>There were many little things awaiting attention at the
laundry, and after two or three cigarettes Mr. Preemby
decided, “It’s time for us to be going, Christina Alberta.”
“We’ll work it out all right,” said Harold on their
departure.</p>

<p>There were intervals of meditation as Mr. Preemby and
Christina Alberta returned in the train from Liverpool
Street to Woodford Wells. “It’s not what I’ve been accustomed
to,” said Mr. Preemby. “It’s all very different from
the way your mother used to manage things.... Less
orderly.... Of course I could keep my clothes locked up
in my trunk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“You’ll do all right. They’re perfect Dears. <i>She</i> loves
you tremendously already,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>But before she went to sleep that night Christina Alberta
experienced compunction. She felt compunction about
these arrangements she was making for her Daddy. She
doubted whether he would be truly comfortable and happy
in that studio in Lonsdale Mews, and able to lead the life
of steadfast curiosity he anticipated with so much quiet
pleasure—ever humming to himself about it and working
his moustache and saying “h’rrmp,” when he was not
otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>This story, it cannot be too often reiterated, is the story
of Mr. Preemby who became, as we shall tell in due course,
Sargon, King of Kings. But Christina Alberta has got
herself hatched into this story very much like a young
cuckoo in a wagtail’s nest and it is impossible to ignore her.
She was virtually in control of him and she had the egotism
of her sex and age.</p>

<p>She had also a pitiless conscience. It was almost the only
thing she could not manage in her life. It managed her.
It was a large, crystalline conscience with no foundations
and no relationships; it just flooded by itself in her being;
it was her gravitational centre and the rest of her could not
get away from it.</p>

<p>When Christina Alberta went up for examination and
judgment before Christina Alberta there was no nonsense
in the proceedings, a fearful frankness; it was cards on the
table, everything in evidence, no etiquette, not a stitch on,
X-rays if necessary. These examinations were all the more
terrible because they were done in what was practically
an empty room, without screens, curtains, standards or
general beliefs of any sort. It is appalling to think of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
drapery and function that was absent from Christina
Alberta’s court of conscience. In the first place Christina
Alberta was completely and explicitly irreligious. In the
next she was theoretically anti-social and amoral. She
did not believe in respectability, Christian morality, the
institution of the family, the capitalist system, or the
British Empire. She would say so with extreme plainness
and considerable detail except when her parent was about.
Prevalent winds of sentiment did not stir her. She did not
find the Prince of Wales ravishing nor <i>Punch</i> funny. She
thought modern dancing tiresome, though she did it very
well, and Wimbledon tennis and tennis-talk an intolerable
bore. She favoured Bolshevism because everybody she
disliked abused it and she hoped for a world-wide social
revolution of an entirely destructive and cleansing type.
What was to follow this revolution Christina Alberta, with
the happy confidence of youth, did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>It is not for us to speculate here why a young woman born
and bred between Woodford Wells and central London in
the opening years of the twentieth century should confront
the world with a mind so entirely swept and void of
positive and restraining convictions; we put the fact on
record. And if she had been sustained by all the beliefs
in Christendom and a sure and certain respect for every
detail of the social code, whatever that code may be, she
could not have confronted the world with a more cheerful
confidence, nor with a stronger persuasion that Christina
Alberta had to behave, in some undefined fashion, well.
Christina Alberta had to be Christina Alberta, clear and
sound, or the court of conscience made things plain and
hard for her.</p>

<p>“Christina Alberta,” the court would say, “you are the
dirtiest, filthiest little thing that ever streaked the dust of
life. How do you propose to get clean again?”</p>

<p>Or, “Christina Alberta, you have been lying again. You’ll
lie to <i>me</i> next. First it was laziness made you lie and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
it is cowardice. What are you going to make of yourself,
Christina Alberta?”</p>

<p>There came a time when the court had to address Christina
Alberta in this fashion: “Your nose, Christina Alberta,
is large beyond comparison. It will probably go on growing
all your life—as noses often do. Yet you are setting
yourself out to charm and fascinate Teddy Winterton.
You go to places where you think you will meet him. You
fuss and preen yourself like any female idiot. You dream
all sorts of things about him, disgraceful things. You are
soppy on this young man in spite of the fact that you know
he is—no sort of good. You like him to touch you. You
sit and look at him foolishly and you gloat. Does he gloat
on you? Isn’t it time you considered where you are going,
Christina Alberta?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now the court was in full session and the charge, the
charge for which there was no defence, was that she was
going to take her absurd, unprotected Daddy and entrust
him and his foolishness and his silly books and his ridiculous
treasures and all his dreams and desires to the
insecure and unsympathetic studio of the Crumbs, not
because of any vague and general hunger for London,
though that was in the background, but because that
studio was frequented by the all too seductive Teddy,
because there she had met him and danced wildly with
him and been suddenly and astonishingly kissed by him
and kissed him. And then he had beguiled her to learn a
dance with him and had got her to come to tea with him at
his studio to meet his sister—who hadn’t turned up. And
there had been other meetings. He was impudent and
provocative and evasive. All her being was in a state of
high excitement about him. Coldly and exactly now the
court unfolded the operations of her mind to her; showed
how the thought of Teddy, always present and never
admitted, had guided her decision to harbour with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Crumbs. Only now did she come to confession and clear
vision. “You have lied to yourself, Christina Alberta,” said
the court; “and that is the worst sort of lie. What are you
going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t let the Crumbs down now. They count upon
us.”</p>

<p>“You are in a mess, Christina Alberta. You are in a
worse mess than we thought you were. <i>Soppy</i> you are
about Teddy Winterton. Why not call things by their
right names? You are in love. Perhaps something frightful
has happened to you. Little rabbits run about the
hedges and every day is like every other day for them;
they waggle their little noses and wiggle their little tails
and do what they like with their paws. Until one day
there is a ping and the snare snaps on the little furry
foot and everything you try to do after that is different.
The snare holds your movements and you must just dance
round it and squeal if you like, till the man comes along.
Is that what has happened to you? And for Teddy!
Teddy, with that open, lying face!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Christina Alberta, “I don’t love him. I don’t
love him. I’ve been silly and soppy and adrift. I am no
more worthy to be called Christina Alberta. But it hasn’t
got me yet and it shan’t get me. I’ll pull Daddy out of it
and myself out of it; I vow and swear....”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said the court.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>It seemed to Mr. Preemby that the first evening he spent
in his new quarters in Lonsdale Mews was the most eventful
evening in his life. Impressions crowded upon each
other. Insomnia was not among his habits, but when at
last he lay upon his shake-up bed he was kept awake for
most of what was left of the night (it was the frayed piece
with the bleak dawn in the middle of it) trying to get these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
same impressions sorted out, impressions about his new
surroundings, impressions about Christina Alberta, impressions
of new and unprecedented personalities, a marmalade
of impressions.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby and Christina Alberta arrived at the studio
according to plan about half-past three, but the Picton van
which had started that morning with Mr. Preemby’s bags
and trunks and the crates of books and curiosities and the
late Mrs. Preemby’s roomy wardrobe, which had after all
been rescued from the clutches of Sam Widgery, did not
arrive until it was nearly six. Unfortunately the furniture
dealer in Brompton Road from whom Mr. Preemby had
purchased a specimen-cabinet and a long low walnut bookcase
had delivered these articles the day before, and all the
animosity of the modern artist towards self-assertive wood
had been aroused in Harold. He and Fay and a friend or
so who had dropped in, had sat up quite late painting these
new pieces a deep ultramarine blue with stars and splashes
of gold like the paper they put around the necks of Ayala,
Tsarist and suchlike champagnes. When Mr. Preemby saw
their handiwork he could scarcely believe it was the same
specimen-cabinet and bookcase.</p>

<p>“I suppose one could get it off again,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“But see how they are assimilated by the room,” said
Harold in high expostulation.</p>

<p>“I mean if we moved at any time,” said Mr. Preemby.
“I know it’s art, and it goes with the things here very
nicely, but there’s neighbourhoods I wouldn’t like to move
into—not with these things as they are. You don’t know
what people’s imaginations are like.”</p>

<p>Matters went a little tediously until the arrival of the
Picton van. The sofa-bed was arranged and rearranged.
The bed things, blankets, sheets and pillow-cases, were to
be put in a bundle on the top of Mr. Preemby’s flat trunk
behind the book-wrapper screen. “We shall have to find
some other place for the bottled beer,” said Harold. “It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
too hot in the kitchen and too dangerous in the passage.
But I’ve an idea we might have it in the scullery under the
sink, with a cloth over it and water dripping on the cloth.
Evaporation. I’ll see about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby was surprised by a yawn. “I suppose you’d
like to have some tea,” said Fay suddenly, and she and
Christina Alberta prepared some.</p>

<p>Harold was obviously in a strained and nervous state.
Mr. Preemby’s patient little figure, sitting about hands on
knees, waiting for Picton’s van, looking at things with
innocent eyes and saying “h’rrmp” had much the same
effect of nervous dislocation upon Harold that the mild
and patient camel has on a horse. Harold chafed and
pranced. He walked about and went upstairs and out
and returned; he smoked endless cigarettes and pressed
endless cigarettes upon Mr. Preemby; he made recondite
remarks in a strained voice. “All this is like something out
of Dostoievsky,” he said to Mr. Preemby. “In a different
scheme of colouring of course. Different, but the same.
Don’t you think so, Mr. Preemby?”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby nodded his head in a sympathetic, humorous,
not too explicit manner. “H’rrmp,” he said. “It <i>is</i> a
bit like that.”</p>

<p>“Things will work themselves out,” said Harold. “Things
will work themselves out. You know that poem of Ruby
Parham’s.” He cleared his throat. “It is called ‘Waiting,’”
he said. “It goes like this—”</p>

<p>His eyes became fixed and glazed; his voice gathered
volume, so that the words seemed more than life-sized.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“After every minute<br>
“Comes another minute<br>
“And then, rest assured,<br>
“Another.<br>
“Like drops from a ledge in the rain.<br>
“You may not want to go on;<br>
“But <i>they</i> will,<br>
“Oh! endlessly<br><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
“Taking your life away, death, not final and complete,<br>
“But death in the midst of life,<br>
“Particles of death,<br>
“Death by attrition.<br>
“Drip on Old Death—in life!<br>
“Slow, dull, implacable, unendurable!<br>
“Drip on.”</p>
</div>

<p>“That ‘Drip on’ is great. But perhaps you don’t like
modern poetry?”</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>mind</i> it,” said Mr. Preemby genially.</p>

<p>“Of course, nothing of a really destructive nature <i>can</i>
have happened to that van,” said Mr. Crumb in a pessimistic
tone.</p>

<p>When Picton’s van arrived and the roomy wardrobe
began its destructive march through the passage, Mr.
Crumb called suddenly upon his maker in a loud distressful
voice and vanished for the better part of an hour.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta was torn between a sympathetic understanding
of Harold’s state of mind and the fear that her
Daddy might perceive the unfavourable reaction he produced
in Harold and be hurt by it. She and Fay became
brightly helpful with the unpacking. “If I might have one
of those blue pinafores of Mr. Crumb’s to put on,” said
Mr. Preemby, “I’d be glad. These black things of mine
show every mark.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crumb’s overall reached far below Mr. Preemby’s
knees and somehow justified his calling it a pinafore. It
brought out something endearingly infantile in his appearance
that appealed to the maternal instinct lurking in Mrs.
Crumb. She struggled with a persuasion that he was
really a little boy of nine who had been naughty and grown
a big moustache and that she had to take care of him and
restrain him and generally tell him not to. The books
were put in the bookshelves as Mr. Preemby said, “just
anyhow”; they could be sorted up later, but the curiosities
and specimens took longer and had to be “put out” more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
less in the cabinet. There were not only real curiosities
and specimens but many little things that Mr. Preemby
had accumulated because they looked like curiosities and
specimens. There was, for instance, a piece of one of the
laundry delivery van mudguards so bent by a collision as
to resemble a human torso in the most striking fashion;
there was the almost complete skull of an unknown mammal,
probably a fallow deer, picked up in Epping Forest,
there was a potato, now rather shrivelled, in which it was
possible to detect thirty-seven distinct human faces and—specimen
of an entirely different quality—a large flint in
which there were no less than fifty-five. Ages ago some
primordial Preemby had discovered and loved that very
same flint and had brought out the likenesses by chipping
an eye here or a nostril there; but Mr. Preemby did not
suspect the help of that remote and perhaps ancestral
hand. Even in waking life Mr. Preemby saw faces in
everything. What he would have been like with a high
temperature it is impossible to imagine.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta’s anxiety about her father’s reception
by the Crumbs diminished as she saw his virtual conquest
of Fay. Fay treated him firmly but indulgently, and they
lost a good deal of time while she tried to see all the fifty-five
faces of the wonderful flint. They had to start and
start again, but always they lost count about “Twen-tee”
or “Twen-tee-one.” The question would arise whether they
were counting one of the faces over again.</p>

<p>Harold returned in a moody state and could be heard, all
too distinctly, kicking Mr. Preemby’s packing cases in the
hall, but Fay went out to him with a lofty sleep-walking
expression in her pale eyes, and the concussions ceased,
and presently Harold came downstairs again looking
almost handsome in nankeen trousers, a blue jacket with
big silver buttons and a voluminous black tie, and was
quite nice to Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“You won’t mind my touching that wardrobe of yours up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
a bit?” he said. “It damps us off, as it is. Kind of reproaches
us. One of us has to be altered, you see, it or me,
and either I paint it or else I get a silk hat with a deep
mourning band and a gold-handled umbrella—which would
cost no end of money. Whereas I <i>have</i> the paint.”</p>

<p>“If you can get the paint off again,” said Mr. Preemby.
“You see if I was to move—<i>back</i>.... It’s all right to have
all this paint in a Mew. But out of a Mew....”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Harold. “My idea is to make a little
pink house of it with windows and so on. Something very
simple. Rather like the scenery of a Russian Sketch.
<i>Chauve Souris</i> sort of stuff. Conventional to the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup>. And
we might put up placards at the corner of it according
to what is going on. Make a bit of an institution of it.”</p>

<p>“So long as it makes things agreeable,” said Mr.
Preemby.</p>

<p>He found his hair being ruffled affectionately. “Dear
little Daddy!” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>But now appeared a new-comer and life was made uncomfortable
and complicated for Christina Alberta again
by the presence of Mr. Teddy Winterton’s candid insincerity.
His graceful body, his movements, his voice, stirred
her senses as she hated them to be stirred; his quiet
impudence invaded her sense of humour; he wounded her
pride and she longed to be even with him. She had no
power over him and he behaved as if he owned her. She
was always letting him go just a little too far. When he
was about her nose cast a shadow that reached to her
horizon. He stood now in the doorway—trousers of one
pattern of tweed, waistcoat of another, Norfolk jacket of
a third extensively unbuttoned in the accepted student
style, and he watched Mr. Preemby carry his collection
of roc’s bones, found near Staines, across the studio on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
tea-tray. His eyes were round with surprise and amusement;
his mouth said noiselessly, “What is it?”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta was not going to have her Daddy
laughed at by any Teddy Winterton. “Mr. Winterton,”
she said. “This is my father.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just get rid of my bones,” said Mr. Preemby, “and
then I’ll shake hands.”</p>

<p>“We’ll just finish up Mr. Preemby’s things and then
we’ll all go round to Poppinetti’s to get some dinner,” said
Fay. “There’s hardly anything left to unpack now.”</p>

<p>“Just one or two Antediluvium bones,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>Teddy seized upon one. “This,” he said, inspecting it,
“is a fossil rhinoceros thigh-bone from the Crag.”</p>

<p>“It’s an Antediluvium horse,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“Forgive me! It’s a rhinoceros bone!”</p>

<p>“Horses had rhinoceros bones in those days,” said Mr.
Preemby. “And the rhinoceroses—! They were incredible.
If I had one I shouldn’t have anywhere to put
it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby was extracted from his overall and restored
to the black coat and the grey felt hat with the black
band. He became one of a straggling party that went out
of Lonsdale Mews to a little Italian restaurant in the
King’s Road. Three neighbours of the Crumbs mixed
themselves up with the party, a very quiet man with silver
hair and a young man and a dusky girl.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby was much impressed by the novelty of
thus going out for dinner, and expatiated on its advantages
to the silver-haired man who seemed to be the
quiet sort of listening man that Mr. Preemby liked to
meet. “You see you don’t have to <i>cook</i> the meal and you
don’t have to lay the table and afterwards naturally there
isn’t any washing up. But I expect it comes more
expensive.”</p>

<p>The silver-haired man nodded intelligently. “Exactly,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Harold Crumb overheard this. “Expensive,” he said,
“it isn’t. No. Every other crime Poppinetti can commit,
but that is barred by the circumstances of his clientele.
He feeds us on stolen pigeons, his <i>dinde</i> is guinea-pig,
his beef, <i>a l’omnibus</i>: what he minces God knows; what he
puts into his ravioli makes even the Lord God repent of
his extreme creativeness. But you see, you don’t <i>think</i>
about his ravioli, you eat ’em, and they’re damned good.
There are always flowers on the table and an effect of
inexpensive refinement. You will see. You will see.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby saw. Poppinetti was a small man but
carefully modelled on Caruso, and he received his large
party with the deference of a diplomatist and the effusion
of a geyser. He was particularly gracious to Mr. Preemby,
bowing profoundly to him, and saluting him with great
richness subsequently whenever he caught his eye. He
seemed to Mr. Preemby to spend the rest of their time
together going to remoter and remoter parts of the restaurant
in order to catch Mr. Preemby’s eye and bow and
smile to him from greater and greater distances. Mr.
Preemby had curious doubts whether he wasn’t being mistaken
for somebody else.</p>

<p>Signor Poppinetti, with an air of peculiar favour, guided
the party to a long, unattractive table near the centre of
the restaurant and took their conflicting orders with the
gestures of a conductor guiding an orchestra through a
difficult passage. Mr. Preemby was passive but observant;
he presently found himself eating macaroni and drinking
a rough red wine with a name that sounded to his London
tuned ears like a challenge. Chianti.</p>

<p>Harold Crumb showed great earnestness in the matter of
macaroni. “In order to taste macaroni,” he assured Mr.
Preemby, “it is necessary to fill the mouth absolutely full,
good measure, pressed in and running over. To cut up
macaroni with your fork as you are doing, is as awful
as to cut an oyster. It—it devitalizes it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I like it cut up,” said Mr. Preemby with unexpected
firmness. And he cut up some more.</p>

<p>“Otherwise,” he said in a confidential aside to the silver-haired
man, “I can’t help thinking it’s earthworms.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Exactly,” said the silver-haired man.</p>

<p>Harold exemplified generously. His rampant face riding
over a squirming mouthful of macaroni was like St. George
and the Dragon on an English sovereign. He whistled as
he ate. Long snakes of macaroni hung thoughtful for a
moment and then, drawn by some incomprehensible fascination,
fled into him. Teddy Winterton and one of the
new-comers from the studio next door emulated him.
Christina Alberta and Fay showed the furtive dexterity
of the female. But Mr. Preemby was glad when macaroni
was over, even though it raised the problem of eating an
egg on spinach with a fork.</p>

<p>But he was not really troubled in his mind as a younger
man might have been. He had the <i>savoir-faire</i> of middle-age.
This restaurant dinner was on the whole a bright
and agreeable experience for him. He liked even the
corrosive taste of the Chianti. This Chianti you drank
out of quite largish tumblers because it was almost as
cheap and light as beer. It did not intoxicate, but it warmed
the mind, and it cast a pleasant and convincing indistinctness
over the universe so that the Tunbridges all
became Tumbridges without any question, and the secret
dreams and convictions of the heart became certain knowledge.
Presently Mr. Preemby found himself able and
willing to tell things and hint much more important things
about his collections to the white-haired man and also to
the dark, untidy girl who was sitting on his other side, and
who came from the other studio and about whose name he
had no idea, and presently to others; and when the bird
came—it was a bird new to Mr. Preemby, and called, he
gathered, <i>rabbkey</i> or <i>turkit</i>—most of the party was talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in the loud, confused, explosive way these young people
affected about the lost <i>Atlantis</i>.</p>

<p>He had never spoken so freely before upon this topic.
At home he had always been restrained by the late Mrs.
Preemby’s genuine lack of interest. And even now he was
not prepared for positive statements or for an encounter
with sceptical arguments about that great lost continent
of the Golden Age. Atlantis had been the scene and substance
of his secret reveries for many years; he knew his
knowledge of it was of a different order from common
knowledge, more intuitive, mystical, profound. From the
outset his manner was defensive, discreet and obscure, as
of one willing but not permitted to speak.</p>

<p>How did he know that there had been this lost continent?</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” he said with the faint smile of peculiar knowledge;
“studied it for years.”</p>

<p>“What is the evidence?” asked the untidy young lady.</p>

<p>“So abundant. Impossible to retail it. Convincing.
Of various sorts. Plato has much about it. Unfinished
fragment. Many books have been written. Many inscriptions
in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“What sort of people were they?” asked the untidy girl.</p>

<p>“Very wonderful people, young lady,” said Mr. Preemby.
“H’rrmp. Very wonderful people.”</p>

<p>“Philosophy, no end I suppose?” asked the young man
from the next studio with his mouth full.</p>

<p>“What we know—a mere remnant,” said Mr. Preemby.
“Mere remnant.”</p>

<p>“How did they dress?”</p>

<p>“H’rrmp. Robes. White robes—extremely dignified.
Blue—azure—when justice was administered. Plato tells
us that much.”</p>

<p>“Could they fly?”</p>

<p>“They understood it. It was not made a practice of.”</p>

<p>“Motor cars? All that sort of thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“If they wanted to. There was less motoring—more
meditation. We live—age of transition. H’rrmp.”</p>

<p>“And then it all went phut?” said the young man from
the next studio. “Submerged and all that. What a lesson!”</p>

<p>“That need not have happened,” said Mr. Preemby
darkly.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby became dimly aware of scepticism.
“There’s not an atom of evidence that there ever was a
continent in the Atlantic,” Mr. Teddy Winterton was
saying to Christina Alberta; “within thirty million years
of anything human. The ocean troughs go right back to
the Mesozoic age.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby would have noticed this remark but the
untidy girl asked him suddenly if he did not think that
the swastika was a symbol derived from Atlantis. He said
he was quite certain it was. She asked what it meant
exactly; she had always been curious about its significance:
and he became guarded and mysterious. She wanted
moreover to know things about the costume of that lost
world, about its social customs, about its religion. Were
women citizens? She was certainly the most intelligent
about it of all the company. The silver-haired man seemed
to be faintly amused.</p>

<p>The rest of the company wandered off into a discussion
of the possibility of going to the Chelsea Arts Ball in the
character of a party from the Lost Atlantis. Many of their
ideas Mr. Preemby thought trivial and undignified. “Leaves
us unlimited scope,” said Harold Crumb. “We could invent
weapons—have wings if we liked. Magic carbuncles
on our shields—illuminated. Mysterious books and tablets.
And a sort of peculiar wailing, drumming music; Mya,
mya, mya.”</p>

<p>He pursed up his face and made a curious mooing noise
with it to convey his intention, twiddling his fingers to
assist the effect.</p>

<p>It was no good protesting against such imaginative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
ignorance. But to the dark, untidy girl and to the acquiescent
man with silvery hair Mr. Preemby continued to be
quietly oracular and communicative from behind his
moustache.</p>

<p>“But how are these things known?” the dark girl persisted.
“There is nothing in the British Museum.”</p>

<p>“You forget,” said Mr. Preemby. “H’rrmp, the Freemasons.
There are Inner Groups—traditions. Thank you.
Just half a glass more. Oh! you’ve filled it! Thank you.”</p>

<p>As he talked he was aware of something going on between
Christina Alberta and Winterton. At first it seemed not
to matter in the slightest degree, but to be just part of the
general unusualness of the gathering, and then it seemed
to matter a great deal. He saw Christina Alberta’s little
fist resting on the table, and suddenly Winterton’s hand
enveloped it. She snatched her hand away. Then something
was whispered and her hand came back. In another
moment the hands were five inches apart and it was as if
nothing had ever happened between them.</p>

<p>He would probably have forgotten the momentary invasion
of his attention by Christina Alberta if something
else had not occurred at the phase of dessert. Poppinetti’s
idea of dessert was a sort of lottery of walnuts—if you
found a sound one you won—masses of compressed and
damaged dates and a few defiant apples. There was a
great crackling. The company was littering the table
with walnut shells, and the green, black and yellow corruption
they had contained, when this second incident
caught Mr. Preemby’s eye. He saw Teddy Winterton
run his hand very softly along Christina Alberta’s forearm.
And her arm was not withdrawn.</p>

<p>Every one was talking just then and for a moment it
seemed to Mr. Preemby that he alone had seen, and then
he caught an observant expression on the face of the silver-haired
man. It was all very confusing, and this Chianti—though
it was really not intoxicating—made everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
swimmy, but Mr. Preemby knew somehow that the silver-haired
man had also seen that furtive familiarity, and that
he too didn’t quite approve of it.</p>

<p>Ought one to take notice? Ought one to say anything?
Perhaps afterwards. Perhaps when they were alone together,
he might ask her quietly, “Are you and that young
man Winterton engaged?”</p>

<p>“A bit too much,” said Mr. Preemby quietly, meeting the
eye of the silver-haired man. “I don’t like that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said the silver-haired man.</p>

<p>“I shall speak to her.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there,” said the silver-haired man warmly.
A very sensible fellow.</p>

<p>A great rustle and a scraping of chairs. Poppinetti,
figuring upon an accounts-pad, came to collect the money.
“I’ll pay for us, Daddy,” said Christina Alberta, “and we’ll
settle up afterwards.”</p>

<p>Poppinetti bowing. Poppinetti on Mr. Preemby’s right
and on Mr. Preemby’s left; several Poppinettis bowing.
A great activity of Poppinettis handing hats and so forth.
Poppinettis whichever way you turned. The restaurant
rotating slightly. Was this Chianti perhaps stronger
than Mr. Preemby had been led to believe? A number of
Poppinettis opening a number of doors and saying polite
things. Difficult to choose a door. Right the first time.
Out into the street. People going by. Taxis. No more
Poppinettis. But a girl ought not to let a young man
stroke her arm at dinner, when anyone might see it happen.
It wasn’t correct. Something had to be said. Something
tactful.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby became aware that he was walking next to
Mrs. Crumb. “It was lovely to hear you talking about the
New Atlantis,” she said. “I wish I had been sitting
nearer.”</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Something very nice about Mrs. Crumb. What was it?
Not so <i>fearfully</i> married, but married quite enough.</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>Mr. Preemby thought they were going back for coffee
and a little talk and then bed; he had no idea of the immense
amount of evening still before him. He knew
nothing as yet of the capacity for sitting up late and getting
lively in the small hours possessed by this new world of
young people into which Christina Alberta had led him.</p>

<p>And in a sort of hectic discontinuous way they were
lively for hours. It became vaguely evident to Mr.
Preemby that there was a periodic “day” set apart by Mrs.
Crumb for evening gatherings in the studio, and that this
evening he had chosen for his settling down was such an
evening. Fresh people dropped in. One it seemed was a
portentous arrival, he came in quite soon after the return
from Poppinetti’s; he was very fat and broad, a white-faced
man of forty or so, rather short of breath, with
exceedingly intelligent eyes under a broad forehead and
a rather loose, peevish mouth. He carried himself with
the involuntary self-consciousness of a man who thinks he
is pointed out. His name it seemed was Paul Lambone,
and he had written all sorts of things. Everybody treated
him with a faint deference. He greeted Christina Alberta
with great warmth.</p>

<p>“How’s the newest Van?” he said, shaking her hand as
though he liked it, and speaking with a singularly small
voice for so ample a person. “How’s the last step in
Advance?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to meet my father,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Has it got a father? I thought it just growed like
Topsy—out of Nietzsche and Bernard Shaw and all the
rest of them.”</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Mr. Lambone turned to him. “What a Handful a
daughter is!” he said, and bowed slightly towards Christina
Alberta, “even the best of them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby replied after the manner of the parents
in Woodford Wells. “She’s a good daughter to me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they aren’t like sons.”</p>

<p>“You have sons, sir, I presume.”</p>

<p>“Only dream children. I’ve not had your courage to
realize things. I’ve married a hundred times in theory
and here I am just a sort of bachelor uncle to everybody.
Poking in among the younger people and observing their
behaviour with”—his intelligent eyes looked quietly over
his garrulous mouth at Christina Alberta—“terror and
admiration.”</p>

<p>Two other visitors appeared in the doorway and Mr.
Lambone turned from Mr. Preemby to greet them as soon
as Fay had done her welcome, a fierce-looking young man
with an immense head of black hair and a little lady like
a china doll dressed to remind one of Watteau.</p>

<p>Conversation became general and Mr. Preemby receded
into the background of events.</p>

<p>He found himself side by side with his friend with the
silver hair, against his bookcase. “I didn’t expect a party,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I thought so too.”</p>

<p>“I only got here this afternoon. The vans came late
and lots of my things are still to be unpacked.”</p>

<p>The silver-haired man nodded sympathetically. “Often
the case,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Every one was talking loudly. It was difficult to hear.
It was confused sort of talking, and whenever two or three
seemed to be interested in what they were saying, Fay
Crumb went and interrupted them as a good hostess
should. Other people, only vaguely apprehended by Mr.
Preemby, got into the studio somehow. There was a red-haired
young lady with a tremendous decolletage; behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
you could see almost to her waist. He h’rrmp’d at it and
thought of saying something about it, something cold and
quiet, to the silver-haired man. But he didn’t. He couldn’t
think of anything sufficiently cold and quiet to say.</p>

<p>Fay Crumb came and asked whether he would like some
whisky or beer. “Not on the top of that nice Chianti,
thank you,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>The conversation seemed to get noisier and noisier. In
one corner Harold Crumb could be heard quoting the poems
of Vachel Lindsay. Then Mr. Lambone came up and
seemed to want to talk about the Lost Atlantis, but Mr.
Preemby was shy of talking about the Lost Atlantis
with Mr. Lambone. “Getting on all right, Daddy?” said
Christina Alberta, drifting by and not waiting for any
answer but an “h’rrmp.”</p>

<p>There appeared three young people with a gramophone
they explained they had just bought, and Fay discovered
that the beer had been forgotten and sent Harold out to
borrow some from a neighbour. These new-comers made
no very profound impression on Mr. Preemby’s now jaded
mind, except that one of them, the owner of the gramophone,
a very fair young man with a long, intelligent nose,
was wearing the big horn of the gramophone as a headdress,
and that he meant to have that gramophone going
whatever else might occur.</p>

<p>The music was dance-music, jazz for the most part and
a few waltzes, and it revived Mr. Preemby considerably.
He sat up and beat time with the leg-bones of a roc, and
presently two or three couples were dancing on the studio
floor. Curious dancing, Mr. Preemby thought; almost
like walking—jiggety walking with sudden terrific back-swipes
of the legs. There was an interruption when
Harold returned with the borrowed beer—bringing its
lenders with it. Then there was a general clamour for
Christina Alberta and Teddy to “do” their dance. Teddy
was quite willing but Christina Alberta seemed reluctant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and when Mr. Preemby saw the dance he was not surprised.</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” he said, and stroked his moustache and looked
at the silver-haired man.</p>

<p>It really was too familiar altogether; for some moments
the principals vanished upstairs, and came back altered.
For some reason Teddy had adopted a cloth cap and a
red neck-wrap; he was, in fact, being an Apache, and the
bearing of Christina Alberta had become very proud and
spirited with her arms akimbo.</p>

<p>Every one backed against the walls to clear a dancing
floor. At the beginning it wasn’t so bad. But presently
this Mr. Teddy was pitching Christina Alberta about,
throwing her over his shoulder, taking hold of her, bending
her backward, holding her almost upside down, both
legs in the air and her hands dragging on the ground.
And she was red and excited and seemed to like these
violent familiarities. There was a kind of undesirable
suitability between them for such purposes. She and Teddy
looked into each other’s eyes with a sort of intimacy and
yet with a sort of fierce defiance. At one point in the
extraordinary dance she had to smack his face, a good hard
smack, nicely timed. She did it with a spirit that made
every one applaud. Whereupon he smiled and took her
nice little neck in his hands and strangled her with great
realism.</p>

<p>Then the gramophone had its death rattle and the dance
was over.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby’s throat had not troubled him much since
dinner, but now he said “h’rrmp” repeatedly.</p>

<p>They wanted Christina Alberta, bright and panting and
shock-headed, to repeat the performance, but she wouldn’t.
She had had a glimpse of the solemn dismay and perplexity
upon her Daddy’s face.</p>

<p>The people from the studio next door were the next to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
give a display: they obliged with an imitation of a Russian
imitation of a peasant dance from Saratoff. There was a
gramophone record that was not quite the proper music,
but it would do. That dance really amused Mr. Preemby.
The young man went down quite close to the floor and
kicked out his feet with the greatest agility and the girl
was as wooden as a doll. Every one clapped hands in time
to the music, and so did Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>And then came a further irruption. Five people in fancy
dress demanding beer. They impressed Mr. Preemby as
strange and bright-coloured, but totally uninteresting.
One wore a red coxcomb and was dressed as a jester in
cap and bells. The others just wore tights and bright things
that signified nothing at all. They had been at some party
given by somebody or other for the “Young people.” They
announced with shouts, “They shut down at midnight. Yes,
they shut down at midnight. When the young people go
to bed.”</p>

<p>It was only too manifest that No. 8 Lonsdale Mews
meant to do nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Beer. Mr. Preemby declined. The last of the beer.
Cigarettes. Much smoke. The last of the whisky. More
gramophone, more dancing and Harold Crumb’s voice loose
again in recitation. Beer or whisky had thickened it.
But there were countervailing noises. Movement. A circle
was cleared. Not more dancing! No. Feats of strength
and dexterity with chairs, performed chiefly by Teddy
Winterton, the gramophone owner, and Harold. This
stunting stopped presently and the company flowed back
towards the middle of the room. Talk Mr. Preemby could
not follow; phrases he could not understand. Nobody
taking the slightest notice of him.</p>

<p>A sense of weariness and futility and desolation came
upon him. How differently were the evenings of the past
spent by the good wise people of the lost Atlantis! Philosophical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
discourse they had, the lute, the lyre. Elevated
thoughts.</p>

<p>He caught sight of Mrs. Crumb yawning furtively.
Suddenly, stupendously he yawned. And yawned again.</p>

<p>“Yaaw,” he said to Paul Lambone who was at his side.</p>

<p>“Proyawaw—Prolly thiswe sitting on my beawawd.”</p>

<p>“You live here?” said Mr. Lambone.</p>

<p>“Come to-day. Christina Albyawawawter arranged it.”</p>

<p>“The devil she did!” said Mr. Lambone, and looked
across the studio at her. For some moments he seemed
lost in thought.</p>

<p>“Very remarkable young woman that daughter of yours,”
he said. “Makes me feel old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>He looked at the wrist-watch he wore, “Half-past one,”
he said. “I’ll start the Go....”</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>Mr. Preemby heard a few sentences of the parting
between Teddy Winterton and Christina Alberta. “Yes
or no?” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“<i>No</i>,” said Christina Alberta with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” she said.</p>

<p>“But you <i>do</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the devil!”</p>

<p>“Not as if there were risks.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t come. It’s preposterous.”</p>

<p>“I shall wait all the same.”</p>

<p>“You may wait.”</p>

<p>“Little Chrissy Hesitation. Anything to please you.”</p>

<h4>§ 8</h4>

<p>It took until past two o’clock for the Go Paul Lambone
had started to remove the last of the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“All hands to the bedmaking,” cried Fay. “It isn’t always
like this, Mr. Preemby.”</p>

<p>“Confess I feel tired,” said Mr. Preemby. “Had a long
day of it.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta regarded him with belated compunction.
“It just happened like this,” she said.</p>

<p>“Not used to such late hours,” said Mr. Preemby, sitting
on his bed when at last it was made, and he did a yawn
that almost dislocated his jaw.</p>

<p>“Night,” said Fay, yawning also.</p>

<p>“We’ll turn in,” said Harold. “So long, Mr. Preemby.”
The yawning seized upon Harold also. What a face he
had!</p>

<p>“Goo-i.”</p>

<p>“Gawooi-i.”</p>

<p>The door closed upon them.</p>

<p>There was much to say to Christina Alberta, but it was
too late and Mr. Preemby was too weary to say it now
And also he had no idea what it was he ought to say.</p>

<p>A casual remark fell out, “I liked that man with the
white hair,” he said.</p>

<p>“Did you?” said Christina Alberta absently.</p>

<p>“He was intelligent. He took a great interest in the Lost
Atlantis.”</p>

<p>“He’s stone deaf,” said Christina Alberta, “and he’s
ashamed of it—poor dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“All this is going to be rather noisy for you, Daddy,”
she said, coming to what she had in mind.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a bit ramshackle,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“We ought to go to Tunbridge Wells quite soon and look
round there.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“Not to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“The next day,” said Christina Alberta. “I’m not quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
sure about to-morrow. I’d sort of half promised to go
somewhere else—. But it doesn’t matter very much
really.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go to Tumbridge Wells to-morrow,” said Mr.
Preemby.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Christina Alberta as if to herself, and
hesitated.</p>

<p>Se walked to the door and came back. “Good night,
little Daddy,” she said.</p>

<p>“Are we going then? To-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No.... Yes.... I don’t know. I <i>had</i> planned to do
something to-morrow. Important in a kind of way....
We’ll go to-morrow, Daddy.”</p>

<p>She walked away from him with her arms akimbo and
stared at those queer pictures.</p>

<p>She spun round on her feet. “I can’t go to-morrow,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” she contradicted.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” she cried, in a most unaccountable and
unladylike way. “I don’t know what to <i>do</i>!”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby looked at her with grave and weary eyes.
This was a new Christina Alberta to him. She ought not
to swear. She did <i>not</i> ought to swear. She’d caught it
up from these people. She didn’t know what it meant.
He must talk to her—to-morrow. About that and one or
two other things. But Heavens! how tired he was!</p>

<p>“You—” He yawned. “You must take care of yourself,
Christina Alberta,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll do that all right, Daddy. Trust me.”</p>

<p>She came and sat down beside him on his little half-fictitious
bed. “We can’t decide to-night, Daddy. We’re
too tired. We’ll settle to-morrow. Have to see what the
weather’s like for one thing. Wouldn’t do to walk about
Tunbridge if it was wet. We’ll decide about everything
to-morrow—when our heads are cool. Why! you dear
little Daddy! It’s just upon half-past two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>She put her arm round his shoulders and kissed him on
the top of his head and the lobe of his ear. He loved her
to touch him and kiss him. He did not understand in the
least how much he loved her to kiss him.</p>

<p>“Dear <i>tired</i> little Daddy,” she said in her softest voice:
“You are ever so kind to me. Good night.”</p>

<p>She had gone.</p>

<p>For some time Mr. Preemby sat quite motionless in a
state of almost immobile thought.</p>

<p>The floor of the studio was littered with burnt matches
and cigarette ends and the air smelt of stale smoke and
beer. On the blue-painted table stood an empty beer-bottle
and two or three glasses containing dregs of beer
and cigarette ash.</p>

<p>It was all very different from Woodford Wells,—very
different indeed.</p>

<p>But it was Experience.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby bestirred himself to undress.</p>

<p>That night-shirt of Saxony flannel had still to be
unpacked.</p>

<h4>§ 9</h4>

<p>In the morning Christina Alberta was still restless and
quite undecided about going to Tunbridge Wells, though
the weather was perfectly fine. About half-past eleven
she disappeared, and after a light lunch with Fay—Harold
was out also—it became evident to Mr. Preemby that the
visit to Tunbridge Wells was postponed for the day. So
he went to South Kensington to look at the Museums
there. He did not go into them actually, he just looked
at them and at the colleges and buildings generally. It
was a preliminary reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The Museums were quite good to look at. Larger, more
extensive, than the British Museum. Probably they contained—all
sorts of things.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta reappeared in the studio about half-past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
six looking very bright and exalted. There was
something about her subtly triumphant.</p>

<p>She offered no explanation of her disappearance. She
was full of the visit to Tunbridge on the morrow. They
must catch a train soon after nine and have a good long
day. She was unusually affectionate to her Daddy.</p>

<p>Harold was out for the evening and Fay had some
reviewing to do, so they had quite a quiet and domestic
evening. Mr. Preemby read with a varying attention a
nice deep confusing book he had found in the room
upstairs called <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> about the Lost
Atlantis and similar things.</p>

<i>The Petunia Boarding House</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">M<small>OST</small> places in the world have sister cities and twins
and parallels, but Tunbridge Wells is Tunbridge
Wells, and there is nothing really like it upon our planet.
Not that it is in any way strange or fantastic, but because
of its brightly delicate distinction. It is clean and open,
and just pleasantly absurd. It is not more than thirty miles
from London, as the crow flies, but the North Downs six
miles away dismiss with a serene and gracious gesture all
thoughts of London from the mind. It is away from the
main line out of London, inconvenient for season-ticket
holders; there is no direct route for the hurrying motorist
over those saving Downs; to Dover and Kent generally he
goes to the east of it, and to Brighton he goes to the west—if
he survive the hills of Westerham and Sevenoaks.
Rich men’s estates encircle it with accessible parks. Eridge,
Bayham, Penshurst Park, Knole and the like protect it
from overmuch breeding of little villa residences. There
it lies, on a rare piece of rocky soil, dry underfoot, airy
and wholesome, with its friendly Common in the midst of
it; its Spa of evil-tasting beneficent waters as the Stuart
princesses drank them, its Pantiles and its Pump Room,
much as Dr. Johnson knew the place. Mount Sion and
Mount Ephraim, Beulah Road and something evangelical
in the air, remind the light-minded visitor that London in
the past was a Puritan city. Many a serious liver has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
touched and found grace at Tunbridge Wells. Many a
light liver has found fresh strength there. And thither
came Mr. Preemby and Christina Alberta seeking a boarding
house—and they could have sought it in no more
favourable locality.</p>

<p>They set about the search in a systematic way as became
a couple, one of whom had been partially trained for sociological
research at the London School of Economics and
partially trained for business at the Tomlinson School.
Mr. Preemby had been for beginning with a general look-round,
just walking round and looking quietly at things for
a bit, but Christina Alberta consulted all the agents in
order, and bought a map and guide to the town and sat
down on a seat on the Common and planned the operations
that led quite readily and easily to the Petunia Boarding
House.</p>

<p>In the guide Mr. Preemby read with approval some very
promising words. “Listen to this, my dear,” he said.
“H’rrmp. ‘General Characteristics. Emphasis might very
well be laid on the character enjoyed by Tunbridge Wells
as a magnet for high-class residents and visitors. The
town is never overrun with trippers, nor are its streets ever
defiled by the vulgar or the inane. Its inhabitants are
composed, for the most part, of well-to-do people who
naturally create a social atmosphere tinged by culture and
refinement.’”</p>

<p>“<i>Tinged</i> is a jolly good word for it, I expect,” said
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“I think my instinct has guided me aright to this place,”
said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>The Petunia Boarding House looks obliquely upon the
Common from where Petunia Road runs into the quaint
and pleasant High Street. It has not the towering magnificence
of the Wellington, the Royal Mount Ephraim, the
Marlborough, or their fellows, which face the sun so
bravely from the hill-crest above the Common, but it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
house of dignified comfort. The steps, the portico, the
ample hall, the name in letters of gold on black, made
Mr. Preemby say h’rrmp several times. An excessively
chubby maid in a very, very tight black dress and a cap and
apron, came and looked at Mr. and Miss Preemby with a
distraught evasive expression, answered some preliminary
questions incoherently, and said she would call Miss Emily
Rewster—Miss Margaret was out. Thereupon Miss Emily
Rewster, who had been hovering attentively behind a bead
curtain, thrust it aside and came ingratiatingly into the
foreground. She was a little high-coloured old lady, with
an air of genteel <i>savoir-faire</i>; she had a lace cap and wore
a great deal of lace and several flounces, and she had the
most frankly dyed chestnut hair that Christina Alberta
had ever seen. “Was it just for a week or so Mr. Preemby
wanted to come, or something—perheps—more permanent?”</p>

<p>Explanations were exchanged. Mr. Preemby was to be
“more permanent”; Christina Alberta intermittent—and
rather a difficulty. The existence of headquarters in
Chelsea was revealed discreetly, but not the fact that they
were in a Mews.</p>

<p>Miss Emily Rewster thought Christina Alberta could
be fitted in if she wasn’t too particular about having the
same room, or exactly the same sort of room every time she
came. “We have to menage,” said Miss Emily Rewster.</p>

<p>“So long as the window opens,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>The rooms exhibited were very satisfactory, (h’rrmp)
very satisfactory. A glimpse of a bathroom was given.
“You say when you want one,” said Miss Emily Rewster.
There was a dining-room with separate tables, and there
were flowers on every table, very refined and pleasant, and
there was a large drawing-room with a piano and a great
number of arm-chairs and sofas wearing flounces so like
the flounces of Miss Emily Rewster, and antimacassars so
like her cap, and with so entirely her air of accommodating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
receptiveness that it seemed as though they must be at
least her cousins who had joined her in the enterprise.
The piano wore a sort of lace bed-spread, and there were
polished tables bearing majolica pots of aspidistra on mats
and little less serious tables for use, and there was a low
bookcase with books in it and a great heap of illustrated
papers on the top. The hall expanded at the back into a
rather modernish lounge where two ladies were having tea;
and there was also a smoking-room, where, said Miss Emily
Rewster to Christina Alberta rather coyly, “the gentlemen
smoke.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been very full this season,” said Miss Emily
Rewster, “very full. We’ve had nearly thirty sitting at
dinner. But of course the season is drawing in now. Just
at present we’re down to nine at breakfast and seven at
dinner; two gentlemen in business here. But people come
and people go. I’ve had two inquiries by post to-day.
One an invalid lady and her sister. They think of drinking
the waters. And there are Birds of Passage as well as
Regulars. Just for a night or so. Motor families. They
take us <i>en route</i>. That’s where we have an advantage in
being so close to the shops.”</p>

<p>She beamed intimately at Mr. Preemby. “Often my
sister or I pop out at the last moment and get in things
ourselves. When every one else is busy. We don’t mind
any little trouble if it makes people comfortable.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been on the separate table system ever since the
war,” said Miss Emily Rewster. “So much more pleasant.
You can keep yourself Quate to yourself if you wish, or
you can be Friendly. People often Speak in the Drawing-room
or in the Smoking-room. And they bow. Sometimes
people get Quate friendly. Play Games. Get up
Excursions together. Quate Pleasant.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta asked an obvious question.</p>

<p>“Very pleasant people indeed,” said Miss Emily. “Very
pleasant people. A retired gentleman and his wife and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
stepdaughter and two retired maiden ladies and a gentleman
and his lady who has been in a forest in Burmah and
so on.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta restrained a ribald impulse to ask what
a “retired gentleman” or a “retired maiden lady” really
meant.</p>

<p>“I’ve always been attracted to Tumbridge Wells,” said
Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“<i>Royal</i> Tunbridge Wells <i>if</i> you please,” said Miss Emily
radiantly. “The ‘Royal’ was added in nineteen nine, you
know, by gracious command of his Majesty.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” said Mr. Preemby with profound
respect, and tried it over; “<i>Royal</i> Tumbridge Wells.”</p>

<p>“Makes it rather a mouthful,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“A very pleasant mouthful for Us, I can assure you,”
said Miss Emily loyally.</p>

<p>The Petunia Boarding House seemed so satisfactory to
Mr. Preemby that it was arranged that he should return
the next day but one, bringing with him some clothes and
other luggage, and that Christina Alberta was to come and
stay with him for a few days—there was a little room
upstairs she could have—and then she would go back to
London and her studies and take her chance of coming
again when there was a room for her.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>In the train back to London Mr. Preemby rehearsed
these arrangements and made his plans.</p>

<p>“I shall come down here the day after to-morrow, after I
have put my collections in order at the Mew. I shall put
the best things so that they can be seen through the glass
of the cabinet, but I think I shall lock them up, and I shall
bring down a few necessary books, and then when I have
quite settled in I shall go and have a good look at these
celebrated Rocks here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“We could come down in the morning,” said Christina
Alberta, “and go and look at them in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Not the same afternoon,” said Mr. Preemby. “No. I
want my mind to be quite fresh and open when I look at
the Rocks. I think it will be best to see them quite early—after
a night’s sleep. When there are no other visitors. I
think—I think, Christina Alberta, that for the first time I’d
better go to them quite alone. Without you. Sometimes
you say things, Christina Alberta—you don’t mean to say
them of course—but they put me out....”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta reflected. “What do you expect to
find at these Rocks, Daddy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby waved his moustache and the rest of his
face slowly from side to side. “I go with an Open Mind,”
he said. “Perhaps all of Atlantis was not lost. Some of it
may be hidden. There are legends preserved by the philosopher
Plato. Partly in cipher. Who knows? It may be
here. It may be in Africa. A plan. A sign. The toad rock
must be most singular. In the British Museum there is a
toad rock from Central America....”</p>

<p>He mused pleasantly for a time.</p>

<p>“I shall take a note-book,” he said, “and several coloured
pencils.”</p>

<p>He continued to meditate. His next remark came after
an interval of three or four minutes, and was a surprise for
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Preemby, “that among all
these artists and people you are not getting Ram
Shackle.</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to think you were getting Ram
Shackle,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“But Daddy, what makes you think I may be getting—Ram
Shackle?” asked Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“One or two little things I saw at the Mew,” said Mr.
Preemby. “Just one or two little things. You’ve got to
be careful, Christina Alberta. A girl has to take care of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
herself. And your friends—decidedly Ram Shackle. Don’t
mind my making a remark about them, Christina Alberta.
Just a word in season.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta’s answer came after a little interval,
and without her usual confident ring. “Don’t you worry
about me, Daddy,” she said. “I’m all right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby seemed about to change the subject. Then
he remarked, “I don’t like that feller, Teddy Winterton.
He’s too familiar.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like him either,” said Christina Alberta. “He <i>is</i>
too familiar.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Mr. Preemby. “I thought you
didn’t notice,” and relapsed into meditation.</p>

<p>But this sudden and unprecedented intervention in her
personal affairs made Christian Alberta thoughtful for all
the rest of the way to London. Ever and again she glanced
furtively at her Daddy.</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten her.</p>

<p>But it was dreadfully true. Teddy Winterton had become—altogether—too
familiar.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>In all ages competent observers have noted the erratic
unexpectedness of destiny, and now Christina Alberta was
to add her own small experience to this ever accumulating
testimony. It seemed to her that in planting him out in the
wholesome quiet of Royal Tunbridge Wells she was securing
for her Daddy the very best possible conditions for
a happy and harmless life. There had, indeed, been a
notable change in the little man since her mother’s death, a
release of will, a new freedom of expression, a disposition
to comment and even form judgments upon things about
him. She had herself likened it to the germination of a
seed brought out of a suppressing aridity into moisture
and the light, but she had not followed up that comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
so far as to speculate what efflorescences might arise out of
this belated unfolding of his initiatives. That here, of all
places, he would meet just the stimulus that was needed
for the most fantastic expansions of his imaginative life,
that for him Tunbridge Wells should prove the way out of
this everyday world of ours into what was to be for him
an altogether more wonderful and satisfactory existence,
never entered her head.</p>

<p>For three days, until a fretting urgency for events carried
her back to London, she stayed in the Petunia Boarding
House, and for all those three days there was no intimation
of the great change in his mind that impended. On the
whole he seemed unusually dull and quiet during those
three days. He liked Tunbridge Wells very much, he said,
but he was greatly disappointed by the High Rocks and by
the Toad Rock when he came to examine them. He even
doubted whether they were not “simply natural.” This was
a terrible concession. He tried hard to believe that the
Toad Rock was like one of the big Maya carvings of a toad
from Yucatan, a cast of which he had seen in the British
Museum, but it was evident that with all the will possible
he could not manage so great an act of faith. All the
decoration, he declared, all the inscription had been obliterated,
and then, making the great blonde moustache bristle
like a clothes-brush: “There never were any decorations
or inscriptions. Never.”</p>

<p>It was clear to Christina Alberta that he must have
evolved very extraordinary expectations, indeed, to be so
much cast down. She found herself very interested in the
riddle of what was fermenting in his mind. It seemed to
her as if he had regarded Tunbridge Wells as a sort of
Poste Restante at which some letter of supreme importance
had awaited him. And there was no letter.</p>

<p>“But what did you expect, little Daddy?” said Christina
Alberta, when on the afternoon of the first day he took her
to the Toad Rock to see for herself how ordinary and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
insignificant a rock it was. “Did you expect some wonderful
carvings?”</p>

<p>“I expected—something for me. Something significant.”</p>

<p>“For you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for me. And every one. About Life and the Mysteries.
I had grown a sort of feeling there would be something
there. <i>Now</i>—I don’t know where to turn.”</p>

<p>“But what sort of thing, what significance did you
expect?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Life a Riddle, Christina Alberta? Haven’t you
noticed that? Do you think it is just nothing but studios
and dances and excursions and char-à-bancs and meal-times
and harvest?” he said. “Obviously there is something
more in it than that. Obviously. All that is just a Veil.
Outward Showing. H’rrmp. And I don’t know what is
behind it, and I am just a plain boarder—in a boarding
house—and my life is passing away. Very difficult.
H’rrmp. Almost impossible. It worries me exceedingly.
Somewhere there must be a clue.”</p>

<p>“But that’s how we <i>all</i> feel, Daddy,” cried Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“Things can’t be what they seem,” said Mr. Preemby,
waving his hand with a gesture of contemptuous dismissal
towards Rusthall Village, public house, lamp-posts, a
policeman, a dog, a grocer’s delivery van and three passing
automobiles. “That at any rate is obvious. It would be
too absurd. Infinite space; stars and so forth. Just for
running about in—between meals....”</p>

<p>Now who would have thought, Christina Alberta reflected,
that this sort of thing was going on in his head?
Who would have thought it?</p>

<p>“Either I am a Reincarnation,” said Mr. Preemby, “or I
am not. And if I am not, then I want to know what all
this business of the world is about. Symbolical it <i>must</i> be,
Christina Alberta. But of what?</p>

<p>“All those years at the Laundry I knew that that life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
wasn’t real. A period of rest and preparation. Your dear
mother thought differently—we never discussed it, h’rrmp,
but it was so.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta could find no adequate comment and
they went on in silence for some time. When they spoke
again it was to discuss how they could get round to the
High Rocks Hotel for tea.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>Mr. Preemby was evidently depressed and more than a
little aggrieved, but he had none of the comprehensive
despondency of your melancholic type. Concurrently he
was quite actively interested in the boarding house, and
the fellow boarders he encountered there. It was a novel
experience for him to be in a boarding house. During his
married life he had always spent his holidays with Mrs.
Preemby in seaside apartments, so that she could supervise
the provisioning properly, and detect, expose and
rectify errors and extortion. They had taken drives inland
during these vacations, or camped on the beach while
Mr. Preemby and Christina Alberta had made sandcastles
or pottered among rocks, and Mrs. Preemby had sat
in a folding-chair and pined for the Laundry. If the
weather was bad they kept in their apartments, where
Mr. Preemby and Christina Alberta could read books
while Mrs. Preemby could pine for the Laundry almost as
well as she could on the beach. But deep in Mr. Preemby’s
heart there had always been a craving for such a collective,
promiscuous life as a boarding house affords.</p>

<p>They had made the acquaintance of the second Miss
Rewster, Miss Margaret Rewster, on their arrival with the
luggage. She was a taller, more anxious and less richly
belaced variation of her sister. They both, Mr. Preemby
discovered, had a peculiar hovering quality. They seemed
always hovering behind bead curtains or down passages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
or looking over from staircase landings or peeping round
doors; poor dears! they were dreadfully anxious not to
interfere with their guests, but they were equally anxious
that everything should be all right. At meal-times they
operated with the joints and dishes behind a screen, and
the chubby maid carried round the plates and vegetables.
And whenever Mr. Preemby looked at the screen he found
either Miss Margaret Rewster peeping over the top of it at
him or Miss Emily Rewster peeping round the end. It
made him quite nervous with his forks and spoons. When
he dropped his serviette he hoped that would pass unobserved,
but Miss Emily noted it at once and sent the
chubby maid to pick it up for him.</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby and Christina Alberta came down to dinner
as soon as Miss Margaret had sounded the second gong,
and so they were the first to be seated and could survey
their fellow-guests at an advantage. Christina Alberta was
quietly observant, but Mr. Preemby said “h’rrmp” at each
fresh arrival. The next to appear were two Birds of Passage,
a young man in Hudibrastic golfing knickerbockers,
and a lady, presumably his wife, in a bright yellow sporting
jumper, who were motoring about Kent; they made
strenuous attempts to seize a table in the window which
was already reserved for Petunia Regulars and were subdued
with difficulty, but perfect dignity, by Miss Emily.
They then consulted loudly about wine—the young man
called the lady “Old Thing,” and “Old Top,” forms of
expression new and interesting to Mr. Preemby, and she
called him “Badger”—and the chubby maid produced a
card of wines that could be sent out for. The young man
read out the names and prices of wines and made his selection
almost as though he were a curate officiating in a very
large cathedral. His wife, to follow out that comparison,
made the responses. “Chablis such as we should get here
might be too sweet,” he proclaimed.</p>

<p>“It might be too sweet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“What of a Pommard, Old Top?”</p>

<p>“Why <i>not</i> a Pommard, Badger?”</p>

<p>“The Beaune is a shilling cheaper and just as likely to be
good—or bad.”</p>

<p>“Just as likely.”</p>

<p>The chubby maid flew out of the room, list in hand, with
her thumb on the wine he had chosen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile under cover of this hubbub the two ladies
Mr. Preemby had seen at tea in the lounge on the occasion
of his first visit, percolated unobtrusively to a table near
the window. They were obviously sisters, both rather
slender and tall with small, round, bright-coloured faces
on stalk-like necks; they had sharp little noses, and one
of them wore tortoiseshell spectacles. A gentleman with
a white moustache, larger and nobler even than Mr.
Preemby’s, accompanied by a small alert-looking wife, was
the next to appear. Possibly this was the gentleman who
had been in a forest in Burmah. The small alert-looking
wife bowed to the slender ladies, who became agitated like
reeds in a wind. The gentleman took no notice of them,
grunted as he sat down, produced glasses and read the menu.</p>

<p>“Tomato soup <i>again</i>!” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s usually very nice tomato soup,” said his wife.</p>

<p>“But Three Times Running!” he said. “It favours
acidity. I don’t <i>like</i> tomato soup.”</p>

<p>The table in the bow window was occupied by three
people who drifted in separately. First came a little, thin,
dark lady in grey, carrying a bead work-bag, then a little
dark, bald man with large side-whiskers whom she addressed
as father, and then a plump, healthy-looking wife with a
radiant manner who swept in and distributed greetings.</p>

<p>“Did you get your walk, Major Bone?” she said to the
gentleman from the Burmese forest.</p>

<p>“Just to Rusthall Common and back,” said Major Bone,
speaking thickly through his moustache and soup. “Just
to Rusthall Common.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“And you got a char-à-banc to Crohamhurst, Miss
Solbé?” The two sisters answered in unison. “Oh! we
had a <i>lovely</i> ride.”</p>

<p>“So picturesque,” said the one with spectacles.</p>

<p>“So open and pleasant,” said the one without spectacles.</p>

<p>“Did you see the sea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, plainly!” said the one with spectacles.</p>

<p>“Ever so far away,” said the one without.</p>

<p>“Just as if the sky had a steel edge,” said the one with
spectacles.</p>

<p>“Exactly like a leetle silver line,” said the one without.</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>Small portions of fish followed the tomato soup, and
were consumed in comparative silence. There was a little
burst of scarcely audible conversation at the window table.</p>

<p>“Now is <i>this</i> the same fish as we had yesterday?” asked
the wife.</p>

<p>“It is a very similar fish,” said the gentleman with
whiskers.</p>

<p>“The menu simply says, ‘Fish,’” said the stepdaughter.</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>“I think our back tyres were too tight to-day, Old Top,”
said the man in plus fours, in a very loud, clear voice. “I
felt the road dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“I felt the road dreadfully,” said the lady in the yellow
jumper.</p>

<p>“I must let them down a little to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“It would be better.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning will do. I won’t trouble to-night.”</p>

<p>“Much better to-morrow morning, Badger. You’re tired
to-night after all that bumping. You’d make your hands
dirty.”</p>

<p>Silence and active business with knives and forks.</p>

<p>“Porruck hasn’t written about that,” said the Major from
the forest.</p>

<p>“Very likely he’s busy,” said his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Silence.</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” said Mr. Preemby.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta searched her mind for some conversational
opening that would give her father a reasonable
opportunity to make an acceptable reply, but she could
think of nothing that was neither too disconcerting nor too
dangerous. She met his eye and he had the expression of
one who holds out against a strain.</p>

<p>Fish gave place to lamb.</p>

<p>“I thought that road from Sittingbourne was just awful,”
said the motoring gentleman.</p>

<p>“It was <i>just</i> awful,” responded his wife.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta saw her father’s face working. He was
going to say something. “H’rrmp. To-morrow, if it is fine,
I think we will go for a walk in the morning.”</p>

<p>The knives and forks were hushed. Everybody was
listening.</p>

<p>“I’d love a walk to-morrow, Daddy,” said Christina
Alberta. “I should think there were some jolly walks about
this place.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Mr. Preemby. “Very probably. The
Guide Book is very reassuring. H’rrmp.”</p>

<p>He had the dignified expression of a man who has carried
off a difficult duty.</p>

<p>Resumption of activity with knives and forks.</p>

<p>“Hard to tell this lamb from mutton,” said Major Bone,
“if it wasn’t for the mint sauce.”</p>

<p>“Peas are never so nice as they are from your own
garden,” said the wife of the whiskered gentleman to her
stepdaughter.</p>

<p>“It’s late for peas,” said the stepdaughter.</p>

<p>The two Miss Solbés and the motoring gentleman began
talking at the same time. Mrs. Bone expressed the idea
that it was hard to get good lamb nowadays. Taking
courage from this sudden swirl of conversation Mr.
Preemby was emboldened to remark to Christina Alberta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
that he had always been attracted to Tumbridge Wells.
He felt the air was a strong air. It gave him an appetite.</p>

<p>“You must be careful not to get fat,” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>The outburst of active human exchanges came to an end.
Baked apple and custard were consumed in comparative
silence. The chubby maid came to ask Mr. Preemby
whether he would like his coffee in the lounge or the
smoking-room. “The lounge I think,” said Mr. Preemby.
“H’rrmp. The lounge.”</p>

<p>The Misses Solbé, bearing glasses containing sugar and
lemon juice, flitted from the room. The people from the
window table followed. The function of dinner was completed.
They found themselves alone in the lounge. Most
of the people seemed to have drifted into the sitting-room.
The gentleman from the forests of Burmah went by towards
the smoking-room, carrying a large cigar which had an
air of also coming from the forests of Burmah. It did
not look like a cigar that had been rolled or filled; it
looked like a cigar of old gnarled wood that had been
hewn from a branching tree. A straw came out of the
end of it....</p>

<p>Christina Alberta stood and contemplated a vast void of
time, two hours it might be, before she could decently go
to bed. “Oh! this is the Life!” she said.</p>

<p>“Extremely comfortable,” said Mr. Preemby, sitting down
with much creaking in a basket arm-chair.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta sat on a glass-topped table and lit a
cigarette. She saw those two hours stretching before her,
and she wanted to scream.</p>

<p>The chubby maid brought coffee and seemed gently surprised
at Christina Alberta’s cigarette. Whisperings off
stage. Then Miss Emily became dimly visible through the
bead curtain at the end of the passage, hovering. She
vanished again and Christina Alberta finished her cigarette
in peace. Mr. Preemby drank up his coffee. Pause. Christina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Alberta swung her legs rhythmically. Then she slid off
the table to her feet.</p>

<p>“Daddy,” she said, “let’s go into the sitting-room and see
if anything is happening there.”</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>In the Boarding Houses of the past the common dining-table
was the social centre where people met and mind
clashed upon and polished mind. But the spirit of aloofness,
the separate table system, has changed all that, and
now it is in the smoking-room or the sitting-room that the
vestiges of social intercourse, advances, retreats, coquettings,
exchanges, games and jests are to be found. But the
company of the Petunia Boarding House was not in a state
of social fusion. The only coalescence was a conversation.
The wife of the gentleman from the Burmese forests had
secured an arm-chair by the side of the fire-place, and she
was describing in a low whisper the numerous servants she
had had in Burmah, to the cheerful wife and the younger
Miss Solbé who was knitting. The Miss Solbé with the
spectacles had fortified herself behind a table on the other
side of the fire and was engaged meticulously with a very
elaborate Patience. The gentleman with the side-whiskers
sat rigidly on one of the sofas, behind a copy of the <i>Times</i>,
while his daughter sat at a table close at hand and also
threaded her way through a Patience. The Birds of Passage,
after inquiries about movies and music-halls, had
gone out.</p>

<p>Nobody took the slightest notice of Mr. Preemby and
Christina Alberta. The two stood for some moments in
the middle of the room, and then panic came upon Mr.
Preemby. A dishonourable panic so that he threw his
daughter to these silent, motionless wolves.</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” he said. “I think my dear, I will go to the
smoking-room. I think I will go and smoke. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
some illustrated papers over there on the bookcase for you
if you care to look at them.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta walked over to the low bookcase and
Mr. Preemby departed, h’rrmping.</p>

<p>She stood pretending an interest in the illustrated jokes
and in the portraits of actresses and society people in the
<i>Sketch</i> and <i>Tatler</i>. Out of the tail of her eye she surveyed
those fellow-guests of hers, and with a negligent ear she
collected the gist of Mrs. Bone’s dissertation upon the
servant question in Burmah. “They will plant the whole
family upon you if they can—uncles and cousins even.
Before you know where you are....</p>

<p>“Of course a white woman is a Little Queen out
there....</p>

<p>“The chief fault of the cooking from my point of view,
was the way it upset Major Bone. His stomach ... far
more delicate than a woman’s.”</p>

<p>“He looks so stout and strong,” said Miss Solbé.</p>

<p>“In everything but that. In everything. But the Curries
they used to make——”</p>

<p>She sank her voice, and the heads of the younger Miss
Solbé and the pleasant mannered lady closed in upon her
for the rich particulars.</p>

<p>What a Lot they were! Christina Alberta reflected. And
they were living beings! The astonishing thing to Christina
Alberta was that they were alive. And being alive and
having presumably been a cause of considerable trouble,
distress, emotion and hope to various people before they
were got alive, they were now all in the most resolute way
avoiding anything that with the extremest stretch of civility
could be spoken of as living. Their hours, their days were
passing; a few thousand days more perhaps for each of
them, a few score thousand hours. Then there would be
no more chance of living for ever. And instead of filling
up this scanty allowance of hours and days with every
possible sensation and every possible effort and accomplishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
here they were, gathered into a sort of magic
box of atmosphere in which nothing could possibly be done.
By anyone....</p>

<p>Christina Alberta felt like a moth caught under a glass.
Well, for a day or so, she had an excuse, little Daddy must
be settled. But then? Nothing could be done here.
Neither joy nor sorrow nor sin nor creative effort—because
even Miss Solbé’s knitting was being knitted to a prescription
on a dirty cutting of printed paper. Everything they
were employed upon was an evasion, everything. Even
the whispered delicate hints of the diuretic, dyspeptic,
infuriating and wildly aphrodisiac effects of Burmah Curry
upon Major Bone in his younger days that were being
handed out by his good lady to her intent hearers, were
just a substitution of second-hand knowledge for realities.</p>

<p>And this Patience! Would she, Christina Alberta asked
herself, would she ever come to play Patiences in Boarding
Houses? Was it credible that some day she also would
come to sit voluntarily in such an atmosphere?</p>

<p>“Rather sell matches in a gutter,” whispered Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>What a marvellous thing is Man! What ingenuities he
has! what powers and capabilities! He invents paper and
perfects printing! He develops the most beautiful methods
of colour printing. He makes cardboard like silk and ivory
out of rags and vegetable pulp. And all it would seem,
that human beings, hanging for a little while in life between
the nothingness before death and the nothingness after
death, should fiddle away long hours in a feeble, fuddled
conflict with the permutations of duplicate sets of four
differently coloured thirteens! Cards! The marvel of
cards! All over the world millions of people drawing
nearer to death and nothingness were pursuing the chances
of the four thirteens: bridge, whist, nap, skat, a hundred
forms of it. Directly they could get in out of the wet and
dark, they sat down to that sort of thing, to the cards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
shining under the still lamps, to being endlessly surprised,
delighted, indignant and despondent by chances that anyone
who chose to sit down to it could work out and tabulate
in a week!</p>

<p>“Getting it out, dear?” said the younger Miss Solbé.</p>

<p>“The spades are <i>Wicked</i> to-night,” said the Miss Solbé
with the glasses.</p>

<p>“Mine is going rather well,” said the daughter of the
gentleman with the whiskers.</p>

<p>“Does your daughter play <i>Miss Milligan</i>?” asked the
younger Solbé sister.</p>

<p>“<i>Eight-eights</i>,” said the comfortable wife. “<i>Miss Milligan</i>
is too much for her.”</p>

<p>“Well, it <i>is</i> a Beast you know,” said the stepdaughter.
“You never know where you are with it.”</p>

<p>“Patience is Patience,” said the elder Miss Solbé. “Nowadays
I often get it out. But not when the spades come as
they’ve done to-night, both twos in the top row, and no
aces till the last round but one.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta thought it was time to change from the
<i>Sketch</i> to the <i>Tatler</i>. She tried to do this with careless ease
and flopped a dozen papers on the floor. “Oh, <i>Damn</i>!” said
Christina Alberta to a great stillness. She struggled to pick
up and replace the disordered sheets. For a time every one
seemed to be regarding her. Then Mrs. Bone took up her
discourse again.</p>

<p>“And you can’t imagine their obstinacy,” she said.
“They are <i>wilfully</i> ignorant. When you show them, <i>then</i>
they won’t do it. I took my cook-boy in hand for a time—boy
I call him, but he was quite a middle-aged man—and I
said to him, ‘just let me show you some plain English
cookery, a boiled fowl with nice white sauce, a few plain
potatoes and vegetables—quite plain with the natural
flavour left in—the sort of food that builds up these brave
young Englishmen you see.’ Of course I’m not a good cook
myself, but anyhow I knew more of English cooking than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
he did. But we never got further than the plain boiled
fowl. He expressed the most violent disapproval—really
violent I mean—of the whole proceedings. As I took hold
of the things and got to work he began to behave in the
most extraordinary way. He tried <i>not</i> to follow what I was
doing. Tried not to. He said that if he cooked a fowl like
that he would lose caste, lose his position in the local guild
of cooks, be perpetually defiled and outcast. <i>Why</i>, he
would not say. When I persisted he rushed up and down
pulling at his black hair—a black madman, his eyes rolling
frightfully. I could never make out what there was in a
plain boiled fowl to cause such excitement. ‘This in my
kitchen,’ he said. ‘This in <i>my</i> kitchen!’</p>

<p>“There I stood quietly boiling my fowl while all this
pother went on. He hovered about me. He talked—fortunately
in his own language. I even caught him pretending
to be sick behind my back. Then he came and implored
me to desist—with tears in his great brown eyes. He tried
to say things in English. The Major always says that he
was simply swearing, but I believe the wretched man really
did believe that if he was to boil a fowl in the plain, wholesome,
simple way nice people in England do it daily, he
would be hung in the air, and the great jays of Burmah
would come and peck—ahem!”</p>

<p>She cast a side glance at Christina Alberta, apparently
lost in the <i>Sketch</i>, and lowered her voice.</p>

<p>“Peck at his <i>entrails</i>, just his insides you know, for a
Thousand, Thousand Years.”</p>

<p>Sensation.</p>

<p>“You never know What Ideas Easterners will get into
their Heads,” said the younger Miss Solbé. “East is East,
and West is West.”</p>

<p>But now Christina Alberta’s attention was distracted by
another set of phenomena. She had discovered that the
thin, bald gentleman with side-whiskers, rigid behind his
<i>Times</i>, was not really reading that interesting vestige of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
British constitution at all. His gaze was not directed to
the edge of his paper, but beyond it. He was staring from
behind that ambush and round the corner of his glasses in
a strange, hard-eyed way, without passion or admiration,
at the upper part of Christina Alberta’s black-stockinged
legs as they delivered their last challenge to human censure
before disappearing beneath her all too exiguous but
extremely comfortable skirt. And also she was realizing
that a furtive but intense scrutiny of her bobbed hair was
disorganizing the Patience of the whiskered gentleman’s
daughter very seriously, and that it was also interfering
with the proper laying out of a second and different sort of
Patience by the elder Miss Solbé. And suddenly, to her
extreme annoyance, Christina Alberta found a flush of
indignation mantling her cheek, and a combative tingle
passing down the backbone of her straight little body.
“Why the devil,” Miss Preemby asked herself, “why the
devil shouldn’t a girl cut her hair to save trouble and
bother, and wear clothes in which she can walk about?”
Anyhow, a mop of well-washed hair was ten times better
than those feeble, aimless interweavings of pigtails and
fringes and scraps and ends. And as for showing one’s legs
and body; why shouldn’t one show one’s legs and body?
It was just a part of the universal evasion of life by these
people that had got most of their bodies hidden away, tied
up in a sort of bundle. Do they ever venture to look at
themselves? Those Solbé girls, once upon a time, they
must have been jolly little girls with an amused interest in
their stalky little legs, before they said Shush! and put
them away.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta’s speculative vein took charge for a
time. What becomes of legs that are put away and never
looked at and encouraged? Do they get etiolated and
queer, dead-white and funny-shaped and afraid of the
light? And after you’ve really packed your body away and
forgotten it, nothing is left of you but a head sticking out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and hands that wave about and feet with hidden and distorted
toes; and you go about between meal-times and take
trips in chars-à-bancs to see what every one sees and feel
what every one feels, and you play games by rule and
example according to your age and energy, and become
more and more addicted to Patience until you are ready
to cover yourself up in bed for the last time of all and die.
Evasion! And the fuss they had caused getting born! The
fuss, the morality and marriages and everything that was
necessary before these vacuous lives were begotten!</p>

<p>But it was all evasion, and the life shown in these <i>Tatlers</i>
and <i>Sketches</i> was evasion just as much. Just as much. All
these photographs of the pushful pretty, the actresses for
sale and the daughters who had to be sold, looked at you
with just your own question in their eyes: “Is this the
Life?” The unending photographs of Lady Diana This, and
Lady Marjorie That, and Mr. So-and-So and a Friend of
the Duke of York or the Duchess of Shonts, at dog-shows,
at horse-shows, at race meetings, at royal inaugurations
and the like, were inevitably suggestive of obstinate doubts
that were in need of a perennial reassurance. The photographs
of people playing tennis and suchlike games were
livelier, but there, too, if you care to look at it, were
evasions. Evasions. Evasions.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta turned over the back numbers of the
<i>Sketch</i> without looking at the pictures before her eyes.</p>

<p>What was this Life she and these people and every one
by games and jokes and meetings and ceremonies and
elaborate disregards and concealments were all evading?
What was this great thing outside, this something like a
huge, terrible, attractive and compelling black monster,
beyond the lights, beyond the movements and appearances,
that called to her and challenged her to come?</p>

<p>One might evade the call of it by playing Patience and
games perhaps. One might evade it by living by rule or
custom. People seemed to do so. A time might come when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
that call to Christina Alberta to be Christina Alberta to
the uttermost and fulfil her mysterious mission to that
immense being beyond the lights might no longer distress
her life. She had thought that in a certain recklessness and
violence with herself she might fight her way out to the
call. She had made love now. Anyhow, she hadn’t evaded
<i>that</i>. But—was it going to matter as much as she had
thought it would matter? She and her little friends were
playing desperate games with the material of love in a
world where Dr. Marie Stopes and Mr. D. H. Lawrence
were twin stars, and it was just something you went
through—and came out much as you had been before.
More restless, perhaps, but no further on. It left you just
where you had been, face to face with the unsolved darkness
and that mysterious, distressing, unanswerable call to
come out of it all and really live and die.</p>

<p>She had made love.... Queer it had been....</p>

<p>These furtive people were watching and watching her,
reading her thoughts, perhaps, penetrating her....</p>

<p>Christina Alberta shut her copy of the <i>Sketch</i> with
something of a snap, and walked out of the drawing-room
with a serene expression. She shut the door behind her and
went downstairs to find what had happened to her father
in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>“I’m leaving the best part of the talk behind me,”
reflected Christina Alberta.</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>She found that her father and the gentleman from the
forests of Burmah, after a very prolonged and brilliant
“h’rrmping” match, had settled down to conversation. But
unhappily the conversation was unsuitable for her.</p>

<p>“Siam, Cambodia, Tonquin, the country is full of such
temples. They take you there and show you them.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful,” said Mr. Preemby. “Wonderful. And you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
do not think the carvings you speak of—? Some high
symbolism?”</p>

<p>Both gentlemen became aware of Christina Alberta,
attentive and hovering.</p>

<p>“Symbolism,” said the arboreal gentleman, “Symbolism,”
and had complicated pharyngeal difficulties. “Heathenish
indecency. Difficult to discuss.... Presence of young
lady.... H’rrmp.”</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” said Mr. Preemby. “Had you come down to
say good night, my dear? We are having a rather—rather
technical talk.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like it, Daddy,” said Christina Alberta, and
went round and sat on the arm of his chair for a moment.</p>

<p>“Good night, little Daddy,” she said.</p>

<p>Reflective moment.</p>

<p>“I think this Tumbridge is going to suit me,” said Mr.
Preemby.</p>

<p>“I hope it will, little Daddy. Good night.”</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>Christina Alberta’s first evening at the Petunia Boarding
House has been described with some particularity because
it is a sample of all the still and uneventful evenings that
seemed to lie before Mr. Preemby there. It impressed
her as an unfathomable enormity of uneventfulness in
which nothing harmful or disturbing could conceivably
occur to him. The last remote possibility of imaginative
disturbance seemed to remove itself next day when Mrs.
Bone announced to the whiskered gentleman’s wife that
she and her husband were off to Bath on the morrow: they
were in luck it seemed; they had got the exact rooms for
the winter in the exact boarding house they had always had
their eyes on. “Tunbridge seems so bleak,” she said.
“After Burmah.”</p>

<p>The dinner was like the previous dinner; the Birds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Passage had gone and Mr. Preemby astonished himself,
Christina Alberta, the chubby maid and the assembled
company by demanding whether it was possible to send
out (h’rrmp) for a bottle or flask of Chianti. “It’s an
Italian wine,” said Mr. Preemby to inform and help the
chubby maid in her inquiries. But there was no Chianti
on the wine-list supplied, and after a conversation markedly
reminiscent of that of the Birds of Passage overnight, the
Preemby table was stocked with a bottle of Australian
Burgundy and, at Christina Alberta’s request, a bottle of
mineral water.</p>

<p>After this display of initiative, self-assertion and social
derring-do, Mr. Preemby did little but h’rrmp throughout
the rest of the meal.</p>

<p>The subsequent life of the drawing-room was also
vacantly similar to the previous evening. Christina Alberta
got her possibly illegal cigarette in the lounge, indeed she
smoked two, and Miss Margaret Rewster looked at her
through the bead curtain near the office and Miss Emily
had a sniff from the landing upstairs, though nothing was
said. And then Mr. Preemby followed Major Bone into
the smoking-room to gather whatever further information
he could about the temple decorations and religious customs
of the peoples of further India. He was inclined to think
Major Bone rather biased by evangelical prejudice. But
Major Bone was not even indignant about Eastern religions
that night. He wanted to talk about Bath, and he talked
about Bath. He told Mr. Preemby in very great detail
about a remarkable occurrence at Bath. He had met a
gentleman named Bone, a gentleman much of his own
age and appearance, a Captain Bone who had also once
been in Burmah. He detailed various extremely dramatic
conversations between himself and the other Bone, occasionally
going back and correcting himself. They had
made the most elaborate comparison of their genealogies,
and it did not appear that they were even remotely related.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
“Most curious coincidence that has ever occurred to me,”
said Major Bone. “In Bath. In nineteen-eh-nine.”</p>

<p>In the drawing-room Patience prevailed and Mrs. Bone
was talking about Bath. The cheerful wife of the
whiskered gentleman said “Deavning” to Christina Alberta
quite suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh! Good evening,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“You had a walk to-day?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been to see the Toad Rock and the High Rock
and Eridge Park.”</p>

<p>“Quite a nice walk,” said the cheerful lady, and restored
her attention to Mrs. Bone. Christina Alberta gathered
she was to be noticed, but not made a pet of.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to go through the <i>Tatlers</i>
and <i>Sketches</i> again. This time the pictures were exhausted,
but there were reviews of books and one or two
short stories. Christina Alberta read them all.</p>

<p>When she went to say good night to her Daddy she had
come to a decision. “Daddy,” she said, “on Thursday,
that’s the day after to-morrow, I must go back to London.
There are some lectures beginning.”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby made no effective opposition.</p>

<p>The third evening was in countenance like the second
except that the Bones had gone and that Christina Alberta
was sustained by the thought that next day she would pass
from the vacuities of Tunbridge to the tangled riddles of
London. And there was a Bird of Passage present, an
untidy young man of the student type with a lot of hair
imperfectly controlled by unguents whose motor bicycle
had broken down just outside Tunbridge Wells. He lived
somewhere away in the north, it seemed, in Northumberland;
he would have to wait in Tunbridge for two or three
days while some broken part of his machine was replaced
from Coventry; he had taken refuge in the Petunia Boarding
House and it was jolly hard luck on him. He couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
budget for a trip to London; he would just have to sit
down in Tunbridge. He was a Cambridge undergraduate
and a geologist; he had a bag of specimens on his machine.
These facts he conveyed across the width of the room to
Mr. Preemby in the course of a rather one-sided conversation.</p>

<p>From the first Christina Alberta did not like this young
gentleman from Cambridge. He was like a younger, cruder
Teddy Winterton, with impudent bad manners instead of
impudent good manners, and with neither bodily grace nor
good looks. And while he spoke to Mr. Preemby he glanced
at her. But she had no inkling of the part he might play
in the life of her Daddy and herself.</p>

<p>When she and her Daddy went into the lounge for coffee
and her cigarette, the young man came and placed himself
at an adjacent table and initiated some more conversation.
Was Tunbridge Wells an amusing place? Was there any
chance of his getting any golf or tennis?</p>

<p>“There are a number of delightful walks,” said Mr.
Preemby.</p>

<p>“Not much fun alone,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“There are the pleasures of observation,” said Mr.
Preemby.</p>

<p>“All this country has been pretty well worked over,” said
the young man of science. “Is there a Museum here?”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby did not know.</p>

<p>“There ought to be a Museum in every town.”</p>

<p>Presently the coffee and the cigarettes were finished.
This evening Mr. Preemby was for the drawing-room.
Major Bone had gone, the smoking-room had no attractions,
and Mr. Preemby had exchanged a few amiable words with
the gentleman with whiskers and hoped to follow them up.
Christina Alberta went with him. At the sight of the old
<i>Tatlers</i> and <i>Sketches</i> she remembered she had bought a
book in the High Street that day, a second-hand copy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Rousseau’s <i>Confessions</i>. She went off to get it. She found
the young gentleman from Cambridge still sitting in the
lounge smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Pretty gloomy here,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>I</i> don’t know,” said Christina Alberta with an open
mind, pausing before him.</p>

<p>“Nothing much doing—what?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a Gala Night.”</p>

<p>“I’m stranded.”</p>

<p>“You must bear up.”</p>

<p>“S’pose you wouldn’t be disposed to come out for a bit
and forage around for some fun?” said the young man
from Cambridge, taking his courage in both hands.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Christina Alberta conclusively, and turned
to go on.</p>

<p>“No offence?” said the young man from Cambridge.</p>

<p>“Nice of you to think of me,” said Christina Alberta
who would rather have been thought utterly shameless than
the least bit prudish. “Good hunting.”</p>

<p>And the young man from Cambridge perceived that he
was dismissed.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta went into the drawing-room for
another tremendous bout of nothingness. But anyhow she
had got Rousseau to read, and to-morrow she would be in
London.</p>

<p>About the Rousseau—? She had always wanted to know
how she stood towards Rousseau.</p>

<p>He carried her on to ten o’clock. But she didn’t think
much of Rousseau. He ought to have known a few of the
New Hope Club girls. They’d have shown him.</p>

<h4>§ 8</h4>

<p>For three weeks Christina Alberta did not return to Tunbridge
Wells, and when she returned she had passed
through a variety of experiences that will have their due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
effect upon the course of this story. This story is the story
of Mr. Preemby, and we have little sympathy with that
modern sort of novel which will not let a girl alone but
must follow her up into the most private and intimate
affairs. Christina Alberta was perplexed and worried and
would have hated the pursuit of such a searchlight. Suffice
it that events had crowded so closely upon her that for
whole days together she thought scarcely at all of her possibly
quite lonely little Daddy at Tunbridge Wells. Then
came a letter that brought her bustling down.</p>

<p>“I think it only right to tell you,” said the letter, “that
Very Important Communications indeed have been made to
me <i>of the Utmost Importance</i>, and that I ought to tell you
about them. They seem to alter all our lives. I know you
are immearced in your studies, but these Communications
are so Important that I want to talk them over with you
soon. I would come up to the Studio to tell you about it
all, but very likely Mr. Crumb might be in and I would
much prefer to tell you here on the Common amid more
congenial surroundings. Some of it you will find almost
unbeleavable.”</p>

<p>“Communications?” said Christina Alberta, re-reading
the letter. “Communications?”</p>

<p>She went down to Tunbridge Wells that afternoon.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE FIFTH<br>

<i>The Scales Fall from Mr. Preemby’s Eyes</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">“T<small>HE</small> scales,” said Mr. Preemby, “have fallen from
my eyes.”</p>

<p>He had chosen a seat upon the Common which commanded
an extensive view of the town, the town crowned
by the green cupolas of the Opera House and lying as
though the houses had been shot out of a cart down the
long incline to the Pantiles. Beyond were the wide distances
of the Kentish hill country, blue and remote.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta waited for more.</p>

<p>“This experience,” said Mr. Preemby, speaking with an
occasional h’rrmp; “all these experiences—difficult to relate.
Naturally I think you are of a sceptical disposition—taking
after your dear mother. She was very sceptical. Of
psychic phenomena in particular. She said it was Nonsense.
And when your dear mother said a thing was
Nonsense, then it was Nonsense. It only made things
disagreeable if you argued it was anything else. As for
myself—always the open mind. No dogma either way. I
just refrained.”</p>

<p>“But, Daddy, have you been having psychic experiences?
How could you have psychic experiences down here?”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you the story in due order. I want you to
see it as I saw it—in due order.”</p>

<p>“How did it begin?”</p>

<p>Mr. Preemby held up a propitiatory hand. “Please! In
my own way,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Christina Alberta bit her lips and scrutinized the tranquil
resolution of his profile. There was no hurrying him; he
had to tell his tale as he had prepared it.</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said Mr. Preemby, “that mine is a very
credulous sort of mind. It is true I am not given to argument.
I do not <i>say</i> very much. But I think and observe.
I think and observe and I have a kind of gift for judging
people. I do not think I am a very easy man to deceive.</p>

<p>“And it is to be noted that I started the whole affair. It
began at my suggestion. I do not know what put it into
my head, but I do know that it was me started the whole
thing going.</p>

<p>“You know, after your departure our little band at the
Petunia Boarding House was reduced to just six persons,
not counting the young gentleman from Cambridge who
was, as Miss Rewster says, a Bird of Passage. Naturally
the six of us felt rather drawn together. There were the
two Miss Solbés, both very intelligent young ladies, and
there were Mr. Hockleby and Mrs. Hockleby, and Miss
Hockleby, and there was me. We were drawn together at
lunch after you had gone off—it was a little showery and we
had a fire in the drawing-room and Miss Solbé, the one
with the glasses, tried to show me one of her Patiences.
We got into quite an interesting argument about whether
it was possible to <i>will</i> which card would turn up next. I
have always inclined to the view that for certain people,
people with the necessary gift, it was possible to do so, but
Mr. Hockleby showed himself extremely sceptical in the
matter. He said that if there was a card on the top of the
pack ready to turn up, and if one willed that a different
card should turn up, then that meant that one had really by
sheer will force to re-manufacture two of the cards in the
pack, make them over again, each into the other, make
them blank, reprint them and everything. But I tried to
explain to him that this is not philosophically sound because
of predestination. If you were predestined to will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
that such a card should be on the top of the pack, then that
card was also predestined to be there. He argued——”</p>

<p>“But is it necessary to tell me all this, Daddy, before we
get to your psychic experience?”</p>

<p>“It is just to illustrate the fact that Mr. Hockleby was an
extremely sceptical person.”</p>

<p>“Was that young man from Cambridge present at the
discussions?”</p>

<p>“No-oh. No. He was not. He had probably gone down
to the Garage to see if his Spare Part had come. He was
always going down to the Garage to see about his Spare
Part.”</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>Mr. Preemby h’rrmped and began a new section of his
narrative.</p>

<p>“It was in the evening after dinner,” he said, “that things
really began. I went into the smoking-room—to smoke—and
afterwards I went into the drawing-room, and when I
went into the drawing-room I had no more thought of
occult phenomena, Christina Alberta, than I had of flying
over the moon. But as I came into the drawing-room I
saw Miss Solbé looking at her Patience cards which she
had just put out, and the way she was holding her hands
on the table reminded me of the way I had read that
people put their hands together on the table when they
were trying experiments in table-turning. And almost
without thinking I said: ‘Why, Miss Solbé, the way you
are holding your hands is just the way they do when they
are going to do table-turning!’ I said it just like that.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hockleby was reading his paper at the time—the
<i>Times</i>, I think, but it may have been the <i>Morning Post</i>—but
he put it down when he heard me say that and he
looked over his glasses at me and said, ‘You don’t believe
in that sort of thing, Mr. Preemby, surely?’</p>

<p>“His wife was sitting with her back to me and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
way she spoke I think she must have been eating some sort
of sweet or lozenge at the time. ‘<i>I</i> do,’ she said. ‘We
did it at home dozens of times before I was married.’</p>

<p>“And I don’t know what put it into my head, Christina
Alberta; it seemed almost as though it was something
behind myself that did it, or it may have been a sort of
antagonism I have always felt about that man Hockleby;
but anyhow, I said, ‘I’d really like to try some of this
table-turning.’</p>

<p>“The younger Miss Solbé, she’s really quite a charming
young lady when you get to know her, and it seems she has
been reading a little occult literature lately——”</p>

<p>“How old is she, Daddy?” asked Christina Alberta, regarding
him with a look of novel suspicion.</p>

<p>“I don’t think she can be very much more than thirty-two
or three. Thirty-four at the outside. And really quite
well-read, quite well-read. Well, anyhow, she said she
would like to try it. And Miss Hockleby, evidently she
had been brought up on strictly sceptical lines by her
father, she was curious too. So to cut a long story short,
we tried it. Only Mr. Hockleby objected and Mrs. Hockleby
overruled that. She was the only one among us who
had ever seen anything of the sort before, and so it was she
who arranged things and told us what to do. We chose a
very solid table, the one that usually has the big aspidistra
on it, and while we were turning out the light——”</p>

<p>“But why did you do that, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“One always does that,” said Mr. Preemby. “It makes
the atmosphere more favourable. We lit a candle which
Miss Margaret Rewster got for us and turned out all the
electric lights; and while we were doing this, in came young
Mr. Charles Fenton and said—<i>what</i> did he say? A
peculiar expression. Ah, yes! ‘Gollys,’ he said, ‘what’s
up?’”</p>

<p>“Was that the young man with the motor bicycle?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The young man from Cambridge. We explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
what we were doing and asked him to join us. He declared
he knew nothing of psychic phenomena, had never experimented
with it at all and seemed very doubtful about taking
part in the trial. ‘I don’t think there’s anything in it,’
he said. ‘We shall just waste our time.’ Indeed I remember
now that he did go out intending to visit a music-hall,
and then he came back and said it was raining. It’s very
important to note that he was not at all eager to join
us and that he was quite uninformed about occult things
because, you see, as I will tell you, we found out presently
that he was a person of exceptional psychic gifts, much
greater psychic gifts than anyone else among us.</p>

<p>“Well, we arranged ourselves about the table in the usual
manner, thumbs and little fingers touching, and for a time
nothing seemed to happen at all. We found Miss Emily
Rewster was peeping in through the slightly open door,
and perhaps that may have had an unfavourable influence.
I suppose she wondered what we were doing and why we
had asked her sister for a candle. Then Mr. Fenton got
very restive and grumbled to himself and said it was the
silliest way of passing an evening he had ever tried. It was
a little difficult to persuade him to keep silence and persevere.
‘<i>All</i> right,’ said he, with a kind of resentment.
‘Have it your own way.’ And then suddenly came two
violent raps, raps like little pistol shots, not immediately
under the table it was, but as if it was in the air a foot or
so under the table. And then the table began to move.
Slowly at first, shifting along the floor, and then quite
strongly twisting and pushing up against our hands. It
was very weird and impressive, Christina Alberta, very
weird and impressive indeed. It rose nearly two feet I
should think and then Mr. Hockleby broke the circle and
it fell rather heavily, I fancy, and the leg hit his shin. He
uttered an exclamation and stooped to rub his leg, and in
the indistinct light he hit his head on the edge of the table.
It seemed almost a judgment on his scepticism I thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
We turned up one or two of the lights to attend to him. ‘I
don’t like this,’ said Mr. Fenton. ‘This is a bit too rum
for me.’</p>

<p>“I asked him to try just once more.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t like this table riding up like this,’ he said.
‘It’s such a bad example for the chairs. Suppose some of
them start playing cup and ball with us! You might get a
nasty toss from a buck-jumping chair. And besides, it’s a
lot too like a Channel crossing for my taste.’</p>

<p>“I think we were all a good deal excited by what had
happened, and all the others, even Mr. Hockleby, were
eager to continue.</p>

<p>“‘Next time I shall <i>press</i> down,’ he said. I think he was
a little suspicious that either his wife or me had something
to do with the phenomena. Evidently spiritualism was a
long-standing dispute between him and his wife. His wife
said she had seen tables move before, but none so actively
as this one had done.</p>

<p>“Down we sat again. We had hardly waited a minute
before the table began rocking about in the most extraordinary
fashion, and then absolutely flew up so violently that
the elder Miss Solbé was thrown back over that Ottoman
there is there, and I was bumped under my chin. At the
same time there was a perfect volley of cracks, like somebody
cracking his fingers, but ever so much louder. It
was quite a comfort to have the lights up again and see
Mr. Hockleby holding the table down firmly in its proper
place. ‘Damn you,’ he said—quite loudly. ‘Damn you.
Keep down.’ Miss Hockleby and her father picked up
Miss Solbé, who was on the floor in a sort of hysterical fit
of laughter, with her feet waving about.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t like this,’ said Mr. Fenton. ‘It goes through
one like an electric shock.’</p>

<p>“He spoke quite simply.</p>

<p>“The only one of us who had had any experience with
occult phenomena was Mrs. Hockleby, and she had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
done anything of the sort since her marriage to Mr.
Hockleby five or six years before, because of his scepticism.
She said now that it was very evident that some very strong
and resolute spirit was present and was trying to communicate
with us, and she explained a simple and safe
method of getting into communication. We were to reform
the circle round the table and we were to call over the
alphabet, and when we came to the letter the spirit wanted
there would be a rap and so we should be able to arrive
at something definite. There is a sort of code quite well
understood it seems in the spirit world, in which you
convey ‘No’ by one rap and ‘Yes’ by two, and so on.</p>

<p>“We set to work at this,” said Mr. Preemby. “We asked
if the spirit would like to spell out anything and it answered
with two very loud raps, and then Mr. Hockleby read out
the letters: A B C and so on. When it got to S the spirit
gave a rap so loud it made me jump.”</p>

<p>“And what did you spell out, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“A name quite unknown to me then—<span class="allsmcap">SARGON</span>, and then
<span class="allsmcap">KING OF KINGS</span>. We asked: was the spirit that was communicating
with us Sargon? The answer came <i>No</i>. Was
Sargon present? <i>Yes.</i> Then who was our communicant?
<span class="allsmcap">OUJAH.</span> Who was Oujah? <span class="allsmcap">WISE MAN.</span> It was a very slow
process spelling out the words in this way, and by the time
we had got so far we were all very tired. Mr. Fenton in
particular was very tired. He yawned and seemed greatly
exhausted, and said at last he felt so weary and muzzy
that he <i>must</i> go to bed. That was really very natural,
because though none of us realized it at the time he was
the actual medium under Oujah’s control. He went to bed
and we tried to go on without him, but the magic had
departed and we could not get so much as a rap. So we
sat for a time talking all this over. Mr. Hockleby in particular
was greatly flabbergasted, and then the rest of us
went to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Evidently Mr. Fenton made the raps,” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“Evidently his presence was necessary for the raps to be
made,” corrected Mr. Preemby. “Quite unconsciously he
was a Mejum.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“Go on with the story,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>“The next evening was wet again, and as his Spare Part
hadn’t come Mr. Fenton was able to join us once more.
He made some little objection at first because he said he
and his people were all Particular Baptists, and he was
doubtful whether this sort of thing was not Necromancy
and forbidden in the Bible. But I persuaded him out of
that. And this time we spelt out a quite singular message.
It was <span class="allsmcap">AWAKE, SARGON</span>! <span class="allsmcap">ARISE OR BE FOREVER FALLEN!</span></p>

<p>“Even from the first I had had a feeling that those messages
from Sargon had something to do with me. Now
suddenly conviction came upon me. I asked ‘Is Sargon
present?’ ‘<i>Yes.</i>’ I knew it would be so. ‘Is it anyone
in the circle?’ ‘<i>Yes.</i>’ ‘Is it this gentleman?’—pointing to
Mr. Hockleby. A very loud <i>No</i>. ‘Is it me?’ ‘<i>Yes.</i>’</p>

<p>“Mr. Hockleby I noted at the time looked annoyed—as
though he felt it was he who ought to be Sargon.</p>

<p>“Then young Mr. Fenton stood up suddenly. ‘Oh! I
can’t stand any more of this,’ he said. ‘My head feels quite
muzzy. I’m sure this sort of thing is harmful.’ He walked
across the room and sat down suddenly with his hands
hanging over the arms of the chair—it was one of the big
arm-chairs covered in cretonne. We all felt very much
concerned, but as for myself I was all in a daze at the
thought of being this Sargon and being called upon so
openly to rouse myself to action. I did not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
fully as yet all that it meant to me, but I did realize that
it meant a very great deal.”</p>

<p>“But what did you think it meant?” said Christina
Alberta sharply, and her perplexed gaze searched his profile.
His blue eyes stared at things far away beyond the distant
hills, strange things, fantastic empires, secret cities, mystical
traditions, and his brows were knit in the effort to keep his
story together.</p>

<p>“All in good time,” said Mr. Preemby. “Let me tell my
story in my own way. I was telling you, I think, that
young Mr. Fenton said he felt heavy and strange. Mrs.
Hockleby happily was quite equal to that situation. She
had seen the same thing before. ‘Don’t struggle against
it,’ she said. ‘Let yourself go. Just lean back in your
chair. If you want to lie quiet, do. If you want to say
anything, do. Let the influence work.’ And she turned
to me and whispered ‘trance.’</p>

<p>“‘What is a trance?’ said Mr. Fenton—just like that.
‘What is a trance?’</p>

<p>“She began moving her hands in front of his face, ‘making
passes,’ I think they call it. He shut his eyes, gave a sort
of sigh and his head lolled back. We all sat round him
waiting, and presently he began to mutter.</p>

<p>“At first it was just nonsense. ‘Oojah Woojer Boojer,’
words like that. Then more distinctly, ‘Oujah the Wise
Man, Sargon’s servant. Oujah comes to serve Sargon.
To awaken him.’ After that he seemed to wander off into
sheer rubbish. ‘Why is a mouse when it spins?’ he whispered
in his own voice and then, ‘That damned Spare
Part.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hockleby said that was quite characteristic of this
sort of trance, and then Mr. Hockleby got a writing-pad
and a pencil to take down anything more that was said.</p>

<p>“And presently when Mr. Fenton spoke again, he did not
speak in his own voice but in a kind of hoarse whisper
quite different from his usual voice. It was the voice of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
this Oujah speaking—Oujah the control. With a slight
accent—Sumerian I suppose.</p>

<p>“Well, the things he said were very astonishing indeed.
I think that this Oujah was anxious to secure my attention
by convincing me that he knew of things, intimate things
that nobody else could know. At the same time he did not
wish the others to know too clearly what he was aiming at.
How did it go? What can I remember? Mr. Hockleby has
a lot of it written down, but so far I have not had time
to make a copy. ‘Child of the sea and the desert,’ he said,
‘the blue waters and the desert sand.’ Is it too fanciful to
find an allusion to Sheringham in that? ‘Cascades and
great waters and a thing like a wheel on a blue shield.’
That is more puzzling. But ‘cascades and great waters’
set me thinking of our big washers. And you remember
the swastika on our blue delivery vans, Christina Alberta?
Is not that oddly suggestive of a thing like a wheel on a
blue shield? The Norse peoples called the swastika the
fire-wheel. ‘Armies with their white garments fluttering,
the long lines drawn out—armies of delivery.’ That again
is queer. One is reminded of armies and also—don’t think
me absurd!—of the drying-ground and the vans. It is like
one thing becoming transparent and your seeing the other
behind it.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of the exact phrases, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hockleby has them written down. If I have not
got them quite right you will be able to read his notes.”</p>

<p>“The swastika may be a coincidence,” said Christina
Alberta. “Or you may have been drawing it on the edges
of the newspaper. You do sometimes. And he may have
seen it.”</p>

<p>“That does not account for the blue ground. He laid
great stress on the blue ground. And there were other
things; matters known only to me and your dear mother.
I could not tell you them without telling you everything.
And small things, entirely private to me. The name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
my late grandfather at Diss. Munday his name was. It
is sometimes difficult to argue about things although one
may be absolutely convinced. And all this was mixed up
with broken sentences about a great city and the two
daughters of the western King and the Wise Man. And
also he called me Belshazzar. Belshazzar seemed to drift
in and out of his thoughts. ‘Come again to a world that
has fallen into disorder.’ These are remarkable words.
And then ‘Beware of women; they take the sceptre out of
the hands of the king. But do they know how to rule?
Ask Tutankhamen. Ask the ruins in the desert.’”</p>

<p>“Pah,” said Christina Alberta. “As though women have
ever had a fair chance!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, Mr. Hockleby has that written down....
And it seemed to me that this too applied to me, for
because of my great fondness for your mother I had let so
many years of my life slip away. He said many other
things, Christina Alberta, richly suggestive things. But I
have told you enough for you to understand what has happened.
In the end Mr. Fenton came-to quite suddenly,
much more suddenly than is usual in such cases, Mrs.
Hockleby said. He sat up and yawned and rubbed his
eyes. ‘Oh, Lord!’ he said, ‘what nonsense all this is! I’m
going to bed.’</p>

<p>“We asked him if he felt exhausted. He said he was.
‘Absolutely fed up,’ were his actual words.</p>

<p>“We asked him if that was the end of his message.</p>

<p>“‘What message?’ he said. He had absolutely no
memory of his communications at all. ‘Have I been talking?’
he asked. ‘This isn’t the sort of thing one ought to
get up to. What sort of things have I been saying? Nothing
objectionable I hope. If so I apologize. I mustn’t do
any more of this sort of thing.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hockleby told him she had never met anyone with
such a promise of great psychic power as he had, before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
He said he was really very sorry to hear it. She said he
owed it to himself to cultivate so rare and strange a gift,
but he said That wouldn’t do for his people at all. The
rain had stopped and he said he thought he would take a
walk down to the Pantiles and back before turning in.
Perfectly simple and natural he was from first to last,
and rather unwilling. And he really did look tired out.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he laugh once?” asked Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Why should he? He seemed a little afraid of what he
had transmitted. The next day his Spare Part came. Mrs.
Hockleby did her utmost to try to get him once more in the
afternoon and develop his Communication, but he would
not do so. He was full of questions about the ferry at
Tilbury and the time of high tide. He would not even
give us his name and address. When I spoke of sending
Mr. Hockleby’s notes to the <i>Occult Review</i> he was suddenly
quite alarmed. He said that if his name appeared in connection
with them it might mean a very serious row with
his family. He would not even allow us to put a Mr. F.
from Cambridge. ‘Put quite another name,’ he said, ‘quite
a different name. Put anything you like that does not
point to me, a Mr. Walker, say, from London. Or something
of that sort.’</p>

<p>“Of course there was nothing for us to do but agree.”</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>“And that was the whole of your communication,
Daddy?”</p>

<p>“It was only the beginning. Because after that I began
to remember. I began to remember more and more.”</p>

<p>“Remember?”</p>

<p>“Things from my other lives. Memories stored up. This
young Mr. Fenton was, so to speak, no more than the
first cut in the curtain of forgetfulness that hung between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
this present life and all my previous existences. Now it
was rent and torn open so that I could see things through
it at a dozen points. Now I begin to realize what I really
was and what I can really be....</p>

<p>“You know, Christina Alberta, I have never actually
believed I was myself—not even as a schoolboy. And
now it is interesting, I know and understand clearly that
I <i>am</i> somebody else. I have always been somebody else.”</p>

<p>“But who do you believe you are, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“So far as I can gather I was first a chief called Porg
in a city called Kleb in the very beginning of the world,
æons and æons ago, and I tamed my people and taught
them many things. Then afterwards I was this Sargon—Sargon
the King of Kings. There is very little about him
here in the Public Library, in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>;
an upstart who took his name, <i>my</i> name, three thousand
years later, an Assyrian fellow is the Sargon they tell about—he
got mixed up with the Jews and he besieged Samaria—but
I was the original Sargon long before there were Jews
or anything of the sort, long before Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob. And afterwards I was Belshazzar, the last
crown prince of the Babylonians, but that is not very clear.
That remains obscure. Only one part of the record is lit—as
yet. And possibly I have been other people. But the
figure that stands out in my memory now is Sargon. It is
his memories have been returning to me. It is he who has
returned in me.”</p>

<p>“But Daddy, you don’t really believe all this?”</p>

<p>“Believe!—I <i>know</i>. Long before this Communication
came to me I had had those intimations,—that assurance
that I was somebody else. <i>Now</i> I see clearly. I can
remember days in Akkadia now just as clearly as I can
remember days in Woodford Wells. I could almost doubt
whether I have ever lived at Woodford Wells; it seems so
far away now. It was when I was in bed the night after
Mr. Fenton had gone that these memories began to come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
I was in bed, and then suddenly I was not in bed—I was
reclining on a couch under a canopy, a canopy of pure
white wool very finely woven and embroidered with
emblems and symbols and suchlike things in golden thread,
and I was upon my state barge upon the Euphrates. Two
King’s daughters, sisters, with slender necks, not unlike
the two Miss Solbés except that they were fairer—and
decidedly younger—<i>much</i> younger—and clad rather more
in accordance with the requirements of a warm climate,
chiefly in woven gold—sat and fanned me with fans of
Eagles’ feathers dyed a royal purple. And at my feet sat
my councillor Prewm, who was oddly enough extremely
like Mr. Hockleby—just the same iron-grey whiskers and
with the same little tufts of hair over his ears. He was
wearing an extremely tall cap of some black woollen substance,
and he was making memoranda with a wooden
style on a tablet of wet clay. It was like writing on a
mud pie. And beyond him were the officers of the boat
on a kind of bridge—they were wearing leather helmets
studded with brass—and then one saw the rowers below,
chained to their oars, and then on either side spread the
broad brown river just crinkled by the breeze. The little
boats fled to make way for us. They had coarse, square
sails, and they lowered them and turned them about all
in precisely the same way at precisely the same time. It
was very pretty to see. Along the banks were little villages
of mud-brick houses and clumps and lines of palm trees;
and everywhere there were primitive contrivances, great
bent poles of wood like giant fishing-rods, for raising water
out of the river for the cultivation of the land. And the
people were all crowded along the water’s edge and bowing
with their hands and foreheads in the water and crying,
‘Sargon the Conqueror, Sargon, King of Kings!’”</p>

<p>“But Daddy, this was a dream?”</p>

<p>“How could I dream of things I had never seen nor
heard of before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“One does.”</p>

<p>“One does <i>not</i>,” he replied with a quiet, invincible
obstinacy. “I remember I was coming back from the
South where I had given peace to a multitude of warring
tribes, Elamites and Perrizites and Jebusites and people of
that sort, and I was returning to my capital. I remember
distinctly many details of the campaign and I know that
with an effort I could recall more in the proper order.
In dreams absurd things happen, dreams when you think
them over afterwards are all at sixes and sevens, but this
is all sane and orderly. One might think, Christina
Alberta, that I had never dreamt dreams and that all these
memories of that previous existence which crowd upon me
now were a deception of my imagination! But I can go
right back as if it was yesterday, and I am surer by far
that I am Sargon than that I am Albert Edward Preemby
your father. The former is my true self, the latter is just
a very simple, unpretending wrapping that for some purpose,
at present inexplicable to me, has hidden me from
the world.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand with a bolder gesture than was
habitual to him. He sat with his eyes wide open, looking
at unseen things.</p>

<p>The girl regarded him for some seconds in silence. She
was trying to grasp the full import of this amazing
speech.</p>

<p>“And <i>this</i> was your Communication?” she said at last.</p>

<p>“You have to know,” he said. “You have to serve and
help me.”</p>

<p>(Help him! How could she help him or herself? How
far was this thing going? What was she to do?)</p>

<p>“Have you told anyone else of this, Daddy?” she asked
abruptly. “Have you told anyone else?”</p>

<p>He turned his solemn little face towards her.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>there</i>,” he said, “we have to be very discreet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
careful—very careful indeed. Here and now is not the
time to proclaim that Sargon, King of Kings, has come
back to the civilization he did so much to found. One
has to be careful, Christina Alberta. There is a spirit of
opposition.</p>

<p>“For instance, I have told something of my first vision—dream
you may call it if you like—to Mr. Hockleby. I
described the resemblance between himself and Prewm.
He was by no means pleased. His is a seditious, insubordinate
nature. And besides—since then—I have recalled
what happened—on the advice of Oujah—to Prewm....</p>

<p>“And I have realized since then that, though one may be
convinced oneself, it does not follow that one will convince
other people. It is true that Miss Hockleby and the two
Miss Solbés have asked me to tell them more of my
dreams—they too call them dreams. But their manner
was curious rather than respectful and I have been
extremely reserved with them.”</p>

<p>“That’s my wise Daddy,” said Christina Alberta, “You
have to think of your dignity.”</p>

<p>“I have to think of my dignity, certainly. Nevertheless—”
His hands went out in a new amplitude of gesture. “Here
I am and this is my world. My world! I nursed it in its
infancy. I taught it law and obedience. Here I am, the
most ancient of monarchs. Rameses and Nebuchadnezzar,
Greece and Rome, the Kingdoms and Empires, things of
yesterday—interludes while I have been sleeping. And
clearly I have been sleeping. And clearly I have not been
sent back to the world without a mission. This is a great
and crowded world now, Christina Alberta, but it is in a
sad state of disorder. Even the newspapers remark upon
it. People are not happy now. They are not happy as they
were under my rule in Sumeria thousands of years ago.
In the sunshine and abundance of Sumeria.”</p>

<p>“But what can you <i>do</i>, Daddy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Dear Princess, my child, that I have to think out.
Nothing hastily; nothing rashly.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>There came a pause. “One person only seems to have
any belief in me. The younger Miss Solbé—— Did you say
anything, dear?”</p>

<p>“No. Go on.”</p>

<p>“I have asked her if she too has had any dreams, any
vague memories of a previous existence. She seems to
have had something confirmatory in a shadowy sort of
way. Very vague intimations. She tells them timidly,
when her sister is not about. But she is under a misapprehension
that her relationship to me was a particularly
close and special one. She was not my Queen. There she
is wrong. It is perhaps natural for her to think so, but I
remember quite distinctly how it was. She was one of the
Twenty Principal Concubines who carried the Eagle fans.”</p>

<p>“Have you told her that?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Mr. Preemby. “Not yet. One has to go
discreetly in all these things.”</p>

<p>Another pause followed. Christina Alberta looked at her
wrist-watch. “My word!” she cried. “We shall be late
for lunch!”</p>

<p>She noted as they walked back towards the Petunia
Boarding House that his bearing and manner had
undergone a subtle change. He seemed larger and taller
and his face was serener and he held his head higher. He
did not h’rrmp once. He seemed to expect people and
things to get out of his way, and it was as if the path was
a carpet that was being unrolled before his advance. Had
she been able to see herself she would have remarked an
equal change in her own carriage. The dance had gone
out of her paces. She walked like one upon whose
shoulders the responsibilities of life might easily become
overwhelming.</p>

<p>They were late for lunch and all the other boarders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
were in their places, beginning. Every one turned to look
at Mr. Preemby’s face as they came in, and then they
glanced at one another. “So you’ve come back to us,”
said Mrs. Hockleby to Christina Alberta, meeting her eye.</p>

<p>“It’s jolly to be back,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE SIXTH<br>

<i>Christina Alberta Consults a Wise Man</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">C<small>HRISTINA ALBERTA</small> and Paul Lambone had been great
friends for nearly a year. He liked her and admired
her, and as became his literary line of work, he studied
her. And she liked him and trusted him, and showed off
a good lot when she was with him.</p>

<p>Paul Lambone wrote novels and short stories and books
of good advice, and he was particularly celebrated for the
pervading wisdom of his novels and the excellence of his
advice. It was his pervading wisdom that had picked him
up out of the general poverty of writers and placed him
in a position of comparative prosperity. Not that his
conduct of his affairs was wise, but that the quality of his
wisdom was extremely saleable. Some writers prosper by
reason of their distinctive passion, some by reason of their
austerity and truth, some by their excellent invention,
and some even by simple good writing, but Paul Lambone
prospered because of his kindness and wisdom. When
you read the stories you always felt that he was really
sorry for the misfortunes and misbehaviour of his characters
and anxious to help them as much as he could.
And when they blundered or sinned he would as often as
not tell you what was the better course they might have
chosen. His book of advice, and particularly his <i>Book
of Everyday Wisdom</i> and his <i>What to Do on a Hundred
and One Occasions</i> sold largely and continually.</p>

<p>But like that James, King of England, to whom the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Bible was dedicated, Paul Lambone was far wiser in his
thoughts and counsels than in his acts. In small matters
and most of the time his proceedings were foolish or selfish
or indecisive or all of those things. His wisdom did not
reach below the level of his eyes, and his face and body
and arms and legs were given over to the unhappiest
tendencies which were restrained by his general indolence
rather than by any real self-control. He was very well off
chiefly because he was lazy; he asked the highest possible
prices for everything he wrote because that was just as
easy as asking the lowest, and there was always a chance
that the bargain would not come off and then he would be
saved the trouble of correcting his proofs. He accumulated
money because he was too unenterprising to buy things
or incur the responsibility of possessions, and so he just
let a trust invest it for him. His literary reputation was
high because a literary reputation in England and America
depends almost entirely upon apparent reluctance of output.
The terse beauty of his style was mainly due to his
sedulous indisposition to write two words where one would
suffice. And in the comfort and leisure his indolence
accumulated for him, he sat about and talked and was
genially wise and got fatter than was becoming. He tried
to eat less as a preferable alternative to taking exercise,
but in the presence of drink and nourishment his indolence
flagged and failed him. He went about a good deal, and
was always eager for new things because they saved him
from boredom, the malign parent of much needless activity.
He had an expensive little cottage near Rye in
Kent to which he could motor without needless trouble
whenever London bored him, and directly his cottage bored
him he would come back to London. And he visited
people’s houses a lot because it was too troublesome to
resist invitations.</p>

<p>There were, it must be admitted, limits to the wisdom of
Paul Lambone. It is often more difficult to see what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
near us than what is far away; many a stout fellow who
looks with a clear, discerning eye upon the universe sees
little of his toes, and ignores the intervening difficulty;
and something sub-conscious in Paul Lambone’s mind
obstinately refused to recognize the defective nature of
many of his private acts. He knew he was indolent, but
he would not allow himself to admit that his indolence
was fundamental and vicious. He thought there was a
Paul Lambone in reserve of very great energy. He liked
to think of himself as a man of swift and accurate decisions
who, once aroused, was capable of demoniac energy.
He had spent many an hour in arm-chairs, on garden seats,
and on Downland turf, thinking out his course of action
on various possible occasions of war, business, criminal
attempt or domestic crisis. His favourite heroes in real
life were Napoleon, Julius Cæsar, Lord Kitchener, Lord
Northcliffe, Mr. Ford, and suchlike heroic ants.</p>

<p>He liked Christina Alberta because of her tremendous
go. She was always up to something; she preferred standing
to sitting, and she kicked her legs about while she
talked to you. He idealized her go; he attributed to her
much more go than she really had. He was secretly
persuaded that her blood must be like a bird’s, a degree
or so above normal. He felt that in imagination she had
much in common with him. He called her the Last
Thing, the Van, the Ultimate Modern Girl, and the Life
Force. He openly professed pity for the unaided single-handed
man who would in accordance with our social laws
presently have to marry her and go her pace and try to
keep her in order.</p>

<p>She had been to tea with him once or twice. She perceived
his admiration and suspected a certain affection,
and she basked in admiration and affection. She liked his
books and thought he was very like what he thought he
was himself. She told him all sorts of things about herself
just to lift his eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>And he was wise all over her and round and about her,
tremendously wise.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>It was quite interesting to be rung up by Christina
Alberta and asked if she might come for tea and advice.
“Come along now,” he said. “I’m probably all alone for
tea.”</p>

<p>And as he replaced the instrument he said: “Now I
wonder what the young woman has been up to! And what
she wants me to do for her.”</p>

<p>He went back to his sitting-room and spread himself on
his very nice Persian hearthrug, and regarded the pretty
silver kettle that swung over his spirit lamp. “It won’t be
money,” he considered. “She isn’t the sort that tries to get
money....</p>

<p>“She’s barked her shins on something....</p>

<p>“Girls nowadays are a lot too plucky—they’re a lot too
plucky altogether.... I hope it’s nothing serious....
She’s just a kid.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta appeared in due course. Erect as
ever, but nevertheless looking a little dashed and subdued.</p>

<p>“Uncle,” she said—for that was her theory of their relationship—“I’m
in trouble. You’ve got to give me all
sorts of advice.”</p>

<p>“Take off that brigand’s cloak,” he said, “and sit down
there and make me some tea. I’ve been watching your
love affair out of the corner of my eye for some time. I’m
not surprised.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta paused with her cloak in her hand and
stared at him. “That’s nothing,” she said. “I can manage
that little affair all right. Such as it is. Don’t you worry
about <i>me</i>, in that respect. Don’t imagine things. But
there is something—something different.” She threw the
cloak over a chair back and came and stood by the silver
tea-tray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“You know my Daddy,” she said, arms akimbo.</p>

<p>“I never saw a more dissimilar parent.”</p>

<p>“Well—” She considered how she should put it. “He’s
behaving queerly. So that people may think—people who
don’t know him—that he’s going out of his mind.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lambone reflected. “Was it ever such a very serious
mind to go out of?”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t make jokes. His mind was good enough to
keep him out of trouble, and now something’s happened
and it isn’t. People will think—some of them think
already—he is mad. They may take him away. And
there’s just him and me. It’s serious, Uncle. And I don’t
know what I ought to do. I don’t know enough to know.
I’m scared. I’ve got no friends that I can talk to about it.
None. You’d think I’d have women friends. I haven’t.
I don’t get on with older women. They want to boss me.
Or I think they do. And I irritate them. They know,
they feel—the proper ones—that I don’t—oh! respect their
standards. And the other sort just hate me. Because
I’m young. The girls I know—no good for what I want
just now.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t there a man,” said Lambone, “on whom you
have a sort of claim?”</p>

<p>“You know who it is, I suppose?”</p>

<p>He was frank. “Things rather show.”</p>

<p>“If you know him—” She left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“I know the young man only very incidentally,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I go to Teddy,” said Christina Alberta without any
further reservations. “I went to him as a matter of fact
before I telephoned to you. He hardly listened to what I
had to say. He didn’t bother.” She winced. Suddenly
tears stood in her eyes. “He was just loafing about in his
studio. He kissed me and tried to excite me. He would
hardly listen to what I had to tell him.... That I suppose
is what one gets from a lover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“So it’s got to that,” Paul Lambone reflected with hidden
dismay, and then remarked a little belatedly: “Not every
lover.”</p>

<p>“Mine—anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And you came away?”</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i> What do <i>you</i> think?”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Lambone. “You <i>have</i> barked your shins,
Christina Alberta! More than I thought.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hell take Teddy!” said Christina Alberta, putting it
on a bit and helping herself by being noisy. “What does
that matter now? I’ve done with Teddy. I was a fool.
Never mind that. The thing is my Daddy. What am I to
do about my Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Well, first you’ve got to tell me all about it,” said Lambone.
“Because at present, you know, I’ve hardly got
the hang of the trouble. And before you do that you
sit down in that easy chair and I make the tea. No, not
you. Your nerves are on edge and you’ll upset something.
You’ve been having your first dose of adult worry.
Sit down there and don’t say anything for a minute. I’m
glad you came along to me. Very glad.... I liked that
Daddy of yours really. Little innocent-eyed man he was.
Blue eyes. And he was talking—what nonsense <i>was</i> he
talking? About the Lost Atlantis. But it was quite nice
nonsense.... No, don’t interrupt. Just let me recall
my own impression of him until you’ve had your tea.”</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>When the tea was made and Christina Alberta had
sipped a cup and looked more comfortable, Lambone, who
felt he was managing things beautifully, told her she might
begin.</p>

<p>“He’s getting queer in his mind, but you know that he
isn’t really going out of his mind,” said Lambone. “That’s
it, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“That <i>is</i> it,” said Christina Alberta. “You see—”
She paused.</p>

<p>Lambone sat down in a second arm-chair and sipped his
tea in a leisurely manner. “It’s a little difficult,” he said.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Christina Alberta, knitting her brows at
the fire, “he’s a person of peculiar imaginativeness. He
always has been. Always. He’s always lived half in a
dream. We’ve been very much together ever since I was
born almost, and from the earliest times I remember his
talks, rambling talks, about the Lost Atlantis, and about
the secrets of the pyramids and Yogis and the Lamas of
Tibet. And astrology. All such wonderful, impossible,
far-off things. The further off the better. Why!—he
almost got me into a dream too. I was a Princess of Far
Atlantis lost in the world. I used to play at that, and
sometimes my play came very near to believing. I could
Princess it for a whole afternoon. Lots of children day-dream
like that.”</p>

<p>“I did,” said Lambone. “For days together I would be a
great Indian chief, sentenced to death again and again—disguised
as a small preparatory schoolboy. The incongruity
didn’t matter a rap. Everybody does it more or
less for a time.”</p>

<p>“But he’s gone on doing it all his life. And he’s doing it
now more than ever. He’s lost the last trace of any sense
that it is a dream. And some one played a trick upon
him at Tunbridge Wells. Not realizing what it might
mean for him. They seem to have muddled about with
spiritualism in the evenings while I was in London, table-rapping
and so forth, and a man who had nothing better
to do pretended to have a trance. He told Daddy he was
Sargon the First, Sargon King of Kings he called him,
who was Lord of Akkadia and Sumeria—you know—ages
ago, before Babylon was born or thought of. The man
who did it couldn’t have hit on anything more mischievous
so far as Daddy was concerned. You see he was exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
ready for it; leaving Woodford Wells where he had spent
half his life in one routine had cut him off, even more
than he was usually cut off, from reality. He was uprooted
already before this idea came to him. And now it’s just
swamping him. It suited him exactly. It—fixed him.
Always before one could get him back—by talking about
my mother or the laundry vans, or something familiar like
that. But now I can’t get him back. I can’t. He’s Sargon,
incognito, come back as Lord of the World, and he believes
that just as firmly as I believe that I am his daughter
Christina Alberta Preemby talking to you now. It’s a
reverie no longer. He’s got his evidence and he believes.”</p>

<p>“And what does he want to do about it?”</p>

<p>“All sorts of things. He wants to declare himself Lord
of the World. He says things are in a bad way and he
wants to save them.”</p>

<p>“They <i>are</i> in a bad way,” said Lambone. “People don’t
begin to know half how bad they are. Still—I suppose
having a delusion about who one is, isn’t Insanity. Does
he want to make some sort of fuss?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, yes.”</p>

<p>“Soon?”</p>

<p>“That’s what worries me.</p>

<p>“You see,” she went on, “I’m afraid he’s going to strike
most people as queer. He’s back at Lonsdale Mews. We
had to come up from Tunbridge Wells yesterday. On a
few hours’ notice. It’s that has upset me. For a couple
of days things went on all right. Practically we were
turned out of the boarding house. There was a frightfully
disagreeable man there, a Mr. Hockleby, and he
seemed to take a violent dislike to Daddy. You know
those unreasonable dislikes people take at times?”</p>

<p>“A very disagreeable side of human nature. <i>I</i> know.
Why, people have taken dislikes to <i>me</i>!... But go on.”</p>

<p>“He and his daughter got upset about Daddy’s queerness.
They frightened the Miss Rewsters, the sisters who run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the place. They said he might break out at any moment,
and either he would have to leave or they would. There
they were all whispering on the stairs and talking of
sending for a policeman and having him taken away.
What could I do? We had to clear out. You see Daddy
had a sort of idea that when he was Sargon Mr. Hockleby
had been alive too and had had to be impaled for seditious
behaviour; and instead of letting bygones be bygones as
one ought to do in such cases, he said something about
it to him, and Mr. Hockleby construed it as a threat.
It’s all so difficult, you see.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t try to impale him over again, or anything?”</p>

<p>“No. He doesn’t do things like that. It’s only his imagination
that is doing tremendous things. He isn’t.”</p>

<p>“And now he’s in London?”</p>

<p>“He has a sort of idea he’s overlord of the King, and he
wants to go to the King at Buckingham Palace and tell
him about it. He says the King is a thoroughly good man,
thoroughly good; and directly he hears how things are,
he will acknowledge Daddy as his feudal superior and
place him on the throne. Of course if he tries to do anything
of that sort he will be locked up for a certainty.
And he’s written letters to the Prime Minister and the
Lord Chancellor and the President of the United States
and Lenin, and so forth, directing them to wait upon him
for his instructions. But I’ve persuaded him not to post
them till he can have a proper seal made.”</p>

<p>“Rather like Muhammad’s letters to the potentates,” said
Lambone.</p>

<p>“He’s thinking, too, of a banner or something of that
sort, but all that’s quite vague. He’s just got the phrase
‘raise my banner.’ I don’t think that matters much yet.
But the Buckingham Palace idea,—something may come
of that.”</p>

<p>“This is no end interesting,” said Lambone, and walked
across his room and back, and then half sat on the arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
of his easy chair with his hands deep in his pockets.
“Tell me; is he distraught to look at?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it.”</p>

<p>“Untidy in his dress?”</p>

<p>“Neat as ever.”</p>

<p>“I remember when I saw him how neat he was. Is he—at
all—incoherent? Or does it all hold together?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. He’s perfectly logical and coherent. He
talks I think rather better and more clearly than usual.”</p>

<p>“It’s just one simple delusion? He has no delusions about
having great physical strength or beauty or anything of
that sort?”</p>

<p>“None. He’s not a bit crazy. He’s just possessed by this
one grand impossible idea.”</p>

<p>“He’s not throwing away money or anything of that
sort?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. He’s always been—careful with money.”</p>

<p>“And he is now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope that lasts. I don’t see that a man is insane
because he believes he is a King or an Emperor—if some
one tells him he is. After all, George V has no other
grounds for imagining he is a King. The only difference
is that rather more people have told him so. Fancying
yourself a King isn’t lunacy, and behaving in accordance
with that idea isn’t lunacy either. It may be some day,
but it isn’t so yet. No.”</p>

<p>“But I’m afraid that people will think that it is....
You see it’s only in the last few days I’ve realized how fond
I am of my father and how horrible it would be for me
if anyone attempted to take him away. I’m afraid of
asylums. Restraint for those who can least understand restraint.
He particularly would go mad in a week, really
mad, if he got into one. That Mr. Hockleby has frightened
me—he’s frightened me. He was so intent and cruel. He
was <i>evil</i> about Daddy—malignant. A nasty man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Yes, I know,” said Lambone. “Hate.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “Hate.”</p>

<p>She jumped to her feet and took possession of the
hearthrug, looking with her bobbed hair and short skirts
and manly pose and serious face the most ridiculous and
attractive mixture of fresh youth and mature responsibility
conceivable.</p>

<p>“You see, I don’t know what they can do with him—whether
they can take him away from me. I’ve never
been much afraid of what might happen before, but I
am now. I don’t know how to take hold of all this. I
thought life was just a lark and people were fools to be
afraid of doing anything. But now I see <i>life’s dangerous</i>.
I’ve never been much afraid of what happened to myself.
But this is different. He’s walking about in a dream of
glory—with absolute wretchedness hanging over him.
Think of it! People getting hold of him! Perhaps hitting
him! An asylum!”</p>

<p>“About the law on these matters I know very little,”
Lambone reflected. “I doubt if they can do very much
to him without your consent. But I agree about asylums.
From their very nature they must be horrible places,
haunted places. Most of the attendants—hardened. Even
if they start well. Every day at it ... too much for
anyone.... I don’t know how a lunatic is made, a legal
lunatic I mean, or who has a right to take him. Somebody—I
think two doctors—have to certify him or something
of that sort. But, anyhow, I don’t think your father
is a lunatic.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. But that may not save him.”</p>

<p>“Something else may. He’s as you say an imaginative—a
super-imaginative man, possessed by a fantastic idea.
Well, isn’t that a case perhaps for a psycho-analyst?”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Who’d talk him back—to something like he
used to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Yes. If such a man as Wilfred Devizes, for example,
could talk to him——”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about these people. I’ve read some
Freud of course—and a little Jung.”</p>

<p>“I know Devizes slightly. We talked at lunch. And I
liked his wife. And if perhaps you could get your father
away into a country cottage. By the by—have you got
any money?”</p>

<p>“He’s got the cheque-book, but he makes me an allowance.
So far there’s been no money trouble. He signs his
cheques all right.”</p>

<p>“But he may not presently.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Of course at any time he may begin putting a
swastika or a royal cipher in the place of his signature,
and then the fat <i>would</i> be in the fire. I shouldn’t know
where to turn. I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lambone.</p>

<p>For some seconds—it seemed quite a long time to
Christina Alberta—he said nothing more. He sat half
leaning upon the arm of his chair and looked past her at
the fire. She had said what she wanted to say, and now
stood waiting for him to speak. His wisdom told him
that things had to be done in this matter very soon; his
temperament inclined him just to stay in that pleasant
room and say things. Meanwhile she looked about the
room and realized how comfortable a wise man could be.
It was the best furnished room she had ever been in.
The chairs were jolly; there were bound books in the
bookcase, a delightful old Chinese horse on the top of it;
all his tea-things were silver or fine china; there was a
great writing-desk with silver candlesticks; the windows
that gave on Half Moon Street were curtained with a
rich, subtly folding material very pleasing to the eye.
Her eyes came back to his big fat face and his peevish
mouth and fine, meditative eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“Something,” he said and sighed, “ought to be done at
once. It isn’t a matter to leave about. He might commit
some indiscretion. And get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of that.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. He’s safe—where you left him?”</p>

<p>“There’s somebody with him.”</p>

<p>“Who won’t let anything happen?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So far, good.”</p>

<p>“But what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“What are you to do?” he echoed, and said no more for
some seconds.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said.</p>

<p>“What in fact are <i>we</i> to do? I ought to see him. Decidedly.
Yes, I ought to see him.”</p>

<p>“Then come and see him.”</p>

<p>“I ought to come and see him. Now.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s.”</p>

<p>He nodded. He seemed to be making an intense internal
effort. “Why not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“And then—then we can broach a visit to Wilfred Devizes.
Generally fix that up. Then our subsequent action
will be determined by what Wilfred Devizes says. The
sooner he sees Devizes the better. It’s a question whether it
wouldn’t be better for you or both of us to see Devizes
first. No. Father first. Then when I’m properly instructed—as
a lawyer would say—Devizes.”</p>

<p>A great tranquillity descended upon him.</p>

<p>She could not restrain a faint exclamation of impatience.</p>

<p>He looked up as if he awakened from profound meditation.
“I’ll come along now,” he said, “to Lonsdale Mews.
I’ll have a talk to your father and then I’ll try to get at
Devizes and fix up some sort of a meeting between them.
That’s what I ought to do. I’ll go along with you now—at
once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Right-o,” said Christina Alberta, “<i>come</i> along.” She
threw on her cloak and clapped her hat upon her head
in a dozen seconds and stood waiting.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’ll just change this jacket,” said Lambone; and kept
her waiting a full ten minutes.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>The taxi dropped them at the entrance of the Mews.</p>

<p>“I suppose it won’t matter our arriving together?” said
Lambone. “He won’t think it’s something preconcerted?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t have suspicions of that sort.”</p>

<p>But when they reached the studio a little surprise awaited
them. Fay Crumb opened the door to them and her eyes
looked paler and her neck longer and her face more absent-minded
than ever.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you’ve come at last,” she said in a flat, distraught
voice. “You see—he’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone!”</p>

<p>“Completely. He’s been away since three. He went out
alone.”</p>

<p>“But, Fay, you promised!”</p>

<p>“I know. I could see he was restless and I kept telling
him you’d be back soon. It wasn’t so easy keeping him.
He walked up and down and talked. ‘I must go out to
my people,’ he said. ‘I feel they need me. I must be
about my proper business.’ I didn’t know what to do. I
just hid his hat. I never dreamt he’d go out without his hat—prim
as he is. I just went upstairs for a moment to get
something—I forget what now—but, anyhow, it wasn’t
there, and I may have spent five minutes looking for it—and
meanwhile he slipped out. He left the door open and
I never heard him go. As soon as I knew he’d gone I ran
up the Mews right up into Lonsdale Road and stood about
there.... He’d vanished. I’ve been hoping he’d come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
back every moment since. Before you returned. But! He
hasn’t come back.”</p>

<p>Her conviction was all too manifest that he would never
come back.</p>

<p>“I’d have done anything—” she said.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta and Paul Lambone looked at one
another. “This rather puts the lid on,” said Christina
Alberta. “What are we going to do now?”</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Lambone followed Christina Alberta into the studio and
sat down at once on the simple couch that became Mr.
Preemby’s bed at night. The couch squeaked and submitted.
He stared at the floor and reflected. “I’ve got no
engagements this evening,” he said. “None.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be much good waiting here for him,” said
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“I feel in my bones he won’t head back here for hours and
hours,” he said.</p>

<p>“And meanwhile he may be up to anything!” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“Any old lark,” said Lambone.</p>

<p>“Anything,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Three,” said Lambone and consulted his watch: “it’s
now nearly five. Do you think there is any particular
place, Christina Alberta, more than any other place, where
we might go and look for him? Where, in fact, we ought to
look for him?”</p>

<p>“But will you come and look for him?”</p>

<p>“I’m at your service.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t in the bond.”</p>

<p>“I want to. If you won’t walk too fast. I feel I
ought to.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta stood before him with her arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
akimbo. “I would bet five to one,” she said slowly, “that he
heads for Buckingham Palace and demands an audience—No,
that isn’t how he puts it—offers to give an audience
to his Vassal, the King. He was full of that this morning.
And then—Then I suppose they will lock him up and
have an inquiry into his mental condition.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Lambone, and then, rising to the occasion:
“Let’s go to Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>“We’ll go there at once,” he said, and moved slowly doorward.
“We’ll get a taxi.”</p>

<p>They found a taxi in the King’s Road. Christina Alberta
did not belong to the taxi-ing class, and she was impressed
by a sudden realization that Lambone had all these thousands
of taxi-cabs upon the streets alert to do his bidding.
The taxi dropped them according to instructions at the
foot of the Victoria Memorial which gesticulates in front
of Buckingham Palace, and they stood side by side surveying
that building. “It looks much as usual,” said
Lambone.</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect him to bend it?” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“If he made a disturbance they’ve cleared him up very
completely. That flag I suppose means G. R. is at home....
I wonder—what do we do next?”</p>

<p>He was rather at a loss. The emotional atmosphere of
this wide-open place was quite different from the emotional
atmosphere of his flat or the Lonsdale Mews. In
the flat and in the Mews the appeal had been for him to
act; the appeal here was not to make himself conspicuous.
He was a man of decorous instincts. A car passed, a
beautiful, big, shining Napier, and he thought the occupants
looked at him as though they recognized him. Lots
of people knew him nowadays and might recognize him.
In his flat, in the studio at Lonsdale Mews, he could foregather
with Christina Alberta without compunction; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
now, in this very conspicuous place, this most conspicuous
place, he had a momentary realization that he and she
didn’t exactly match, he with his finished effect of being a
man about town, a large, distinguished, mature man about
town, and she with her air of excessive youthfulness, her
very short skirts and her hat, like the calyptra of a black
mushroom, pulled over her bobbed hair. People might
think them an incongruous couple. People might wonder
what had brought them together and what he was up to
with her.</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to ask some one,” she said.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Oh!—one of those sentinels.”</p>

<p>“May one speak to the sentinels at the gate? Frankly,
I’m afraid of those tremendous chaps in the busbies. I’d as
soon speak to the Horse Guard in Whitehall. He’d probably
look right over our heads and say nothing. And we
should just dither away from beneath him. I couldn’t
stand that....”</p>

<p>“But what are we to do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing rash.”</p>

<p>“We <i>must</i> ask some one.”</p>

<p>“Away there on the left towards Victoria there’s what
looks like the real business way in. There’s two policemen.
I’m not afraid of policemen. No. And of course
that man at the corner is a plain-clothes man.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s ask <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p>Lambone made no move. “Suppose he hasn’t come here
at all!”</p>

<p>“I know he meant to do so.”</p>

<p>“I suppose if he hasn’t come,” said Lambone, “we ought
to wait about here on the chance of his coming.” He felt
extremely like flight at that instant. “There ought to be
seats here.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said, with a sudden return to manly
decision, “let’s ask one of those bobbies at the far gate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>The policeman at the gate to whom they addressed themselves
listened gravely to their inquiries, making no instant
reply. He belonged to that great majority of English
speakers who are engaged upon the improvement of the
word “yes.” His particular idea was to make it long
and purry.</p>

<p>“Yurrss,” he said breaking presently into speech:
“Yurrss. There was a small gentleman without a ’at on.
Yurrss. He <i>’ad</i> blue eyes. And a moustache? Yurrss,
come to think of it there <i>was</i> a moustache. A rather considerable
moustache. Well, ’e said he wanted to speak to
King George on a rather urgent matter. It always is a
rather urgent matter. Never ‘quite.’ Always ‘rather.’ We
replied, according to formula, ’e’d ’ave to write for’n
’pointment. ‘Perhaps,’ ’e says, ‘You don’t know who I
am?’ They all say that. ‘I guess it’s something important,’
I says. ‘Not the Ormighty, by any chance,’ I says.
But ’e was ’ere last week and ’e wouldn’ go away and they
’ad to take ’im off in a taxi-cab. You know there <i>was</i> a
chap ’ere, sir—Thursday last or Friday, I forget which—with
a long white beard and ’air all down ’is back. Very
like ’im I should think. Well any’ow this sort of dashed
your gentleman. He kind of mumbled a name.”</p>

<p>“Not Sargon?” asked Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“It might ’ave been. Any’ow, ‘There is no exceptions,’ I
says. ‘Not even if you was a close relation. We got no
option here. We’re just machines.’ He stood sort of looking
baffled for a time. ‘All this must be altered,’ he said
in a sort of low, earnest voice. ‘It’s the duty of every king
to give audience to every one, every day.’ I says, ‘Very
likely it is, sir. But we policemen aren’t in any position to
’elp it,’ I says, ‘much less alter it.’ So off ’e goes. I kind
of tipped the wink to the detective at the corner and ’e
watched ’im go along the front and then cross over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
monument and stand looking up at the windows. And
then ’e shrugged ’is shoulders and took ’imself off. And
that’s the last I see of ’im.”</p>

<p>Lambone asked a superfluous question.</p>

<p>“It might be Piccadilly way,” said the policeman, “it
might be down towards Trafalgar Square. Fact is, sir, I
didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>It was clear that the conversation was drawing to an end.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>“So that’s that,” said Lambone. “So far, good. He’s
still at large.”</p>

<p>He expressed his thanks to the policeman.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said with an air of bringing out the solution
of a difficult problem very successfully, “all we have
to do is to find him.”</p>

<p>“But where?”</p>

<p>“That’s the essence of the problem.”</p>

<p>He led the way back to the Victoria Memorial and stood
side by side with Christina Alberta beneath that perfect
symbol of the British Empire, the statue of Queen Victoria.
They stared down the Mall to the distant Admiralty Arch,
and for a moment neither of them said a word. It was a
warm and serene October afternoon; the cupolas of Whitehall
and Westminster’s two towers and a brown pile of
mansions were just visible over the trees on the right,
transfigured to beauty by the afternoon glow; the two tall
columns of the Duke of York and Nelson rose over the
trees and buildings to the left; it was in the pause before
the dinner and theatre traffic begins, and only a few taxi-cabs
and a car or so emphasized the breadth of the processional
roadway. Half a dozen windows in the Admiralty
had taken fire already from the sinking sun.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Lambone, “he’s gone down there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Christina Alberta stood with her arms akimbo and her
feet a little apart. “I suppose he has.”</p>

<p>The wide road ran straight to the distant Admiralty Arch.
And through that remote little opening was Trafalgar
Square and Charing Cross and a radiating tangle of roads
and streets spreading out and beyond and further into the
twilight blue.</p>

<p>“What will he make for now?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows. I’m bankrupt. I haven’t an idea.”</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a little while.</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” she said, “just gone,” and that simple and
desolating thought filled her mind.</p>

<p>But the thoughts of Paul Lambone were more complex
and intricate.</p>

<p>He perceived that a serious adventure was happening to
him and that he was called upon to exert himself. He had
suddenly been called away from his tea and hot tea-cake to
hunt a slightly demented comparative stranger about
London. He wanted to do it, and he wanted to do it properly
and in a way to impress Christina Alberta. And his
intelligence told him that the best thing he could do would
be to follow upon the probable track of his quarry and
come up with him before he got into mischief. Or while
he was getting into mischief—and interfere and carry him
off. And meanwhile his more exercised lower nature was
exhorting him to leave Christina Alberta to do the pursuing
alone, and go back as straightly as possible to his
ample arm-chair and sit down and think things out. And
then go to his best club to dinner. And in fact quietly and
neatly get out of this unexpected and tiresome business
altogether.</p>

<p>And then he looked at Christina Alberta and realized that
he could do nothing of the sort. He couldn’t leave her. He
looked at her profile, the profile of a grave child, and an
almost maternal emotion was aroused in him. She looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
with anxious and perplexed eyes at the blue and limitless
city that had swallowed up her Daddy. The scene was still
warm with the evening sun-glow, but the blue twilight
gathered in the lower eastern sky. Here and there a yellow
pin-point showed that London was beginning to light itself
up. She couldn’t go down that road alone. Absurdly,
preposterously they were linked. The impulse to disentangle
himself was the impulse of a selfish discretion that
was rapidly taking all the happiness out of his life and
leaving security and luxuries in its place. This was a call
to that latent Paul Lambone to <i>act</i>. Even supposing she
was a common, queer little flapper that his imagination had
made into a friend and heroine, was that any reason whatever
why he shouldn’t see her through this trouble that had
come upon her?</p>

<p>He made his decision.</p>

<p>“He won’t go back for ages,” he said following up the
problem. “Nobody would on an evening like this.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “But I don’t see that that gives me any
hint of what I ought to do next.”</p>

<p>“We can keep together and go down towards Trafalgar
Square. We might look along the Embankment. When
we are tired we can get some dinner somewhere. You can
get a sort of dinner almost anywhere I suppose. We shall
want our dinner.... Perhaps it’s not so hopeless a job as
it seems at first. A big job but not a hopeless one. There
are limitations to what he may do. Limitations in himself
I mean. I don’t think he’ll go into uninteresting streets.
His feeling is—spectacular. He’s much more likely to
keep to open spaces and near conspicuous buildings. That
cuts out a lot of streets. And he won’t go far east. In
another hour the city will be shutting up and going home
and putting out its lights. He’ll turn back out of that—westward.”</p>

<p>“You can spare the time?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no engagements at all to-night. It was to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
an ‘off’ night. And this business attracts me. It is interesting
to see just how far we can infer and guess his proceedings.
It’s a curious mental exercise.... Do you
know I think we shall find him!”</p>

<p>She stood quite still for some moments.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you to come with me,” she said.</p>

<p>“I come on one condition.... That you don’t walk
too fast. We’ve never walked much together, Christina
Alberta, but I’ve seen enough of you to know that you
walk abominably fast.”</p>

<h4>§ 8</h4>

<p>Every one knows the Café Neptune near Piccadilly Circus
and the various crowd that assembles there. There you
see artists and painters that are scarcely artists, poets and
mere writers, artists’ models and drug-fiends, undergraduates
in arts and medicine who are no better than
they should be, publishers and gay lawyers, Bolsheviks and
White Refugees, American visitors who come to scoff and
remain a prey, stray students from the Far East and Jews
and Jews and Jews—and Jewesses. And hither at about
half-past nine that night came a stout, large, and wearily-distinguished-looking
man accompanied by an attractive
young lady in short skirts and bobbed hair who carried a
large and shapely nose high and sternly, and they threaded
their way among the tables through the smoky atmosphere,
seeking a congenial place. Out of the garrulous confusing
mirk arose a young man with a mop of red hair and protruded
a rampant face and asked in a large whisper: “<i>Have
you found him?</i>”</p>

<p>“Not a trace,” said Paul Lambone.</p>

<p>Fay Crumb’s face looked up from the table through a
haze of cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>“Nor we. <i>We’ve</i> been looking too.”</p>

<p>“As well here as anywhere,” said the stout man. “Where
have you looked?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Here,” said Harold, “and hereabouts. It seemed a suitable
rendezvous.”</p>

<p>“We’ve ranged far and wide,” said Lambone. “We’ve done
miles—oh! endless miles. And Christina Alberta has
refused all nourishment—for me as well as for herself. At
last I said, either I sit down and eat or I drop down and
die. May we take these chairs? You have that one, Christina
Alberta. Waiter! It is a case of extreme fatigue.
No—neither Munchner nor Pilsener. I must have champagne.
Bollinger 1914 will do and it must be iced—rather
over-iced, and with it, sandwiches—a very considerable
number of sandwiches of smoked salmon. Yes—a dozen.
Ah!”</p>

<p>He dropped his wrists on the table. “When I have
had some drink I will talk,” he wheezed and became
silent.</p>

<p>“When did you leave the Mews?” Christina Alberta asked
Fay.</p>

<p>“Half-past eight.... Not a sign of him.”</p>

<p>“Have you been far?” Harold asked Lambone.</p>

<p>“<i>Far!</i>” said Lambone and for a time was incapable of
more.</p>

<p>His voice seemed to recede in perspective. “Asking
policemen for a small, hatless man. Over great areas of
London. On and on—from one policeman to another....
She’s a most determined young woman. God help the
man who wins her love! Not a soul had seen him. But I
can’t talk <i>yet</i>....”</p>

<p>Harold clawed his chin softly with long artistic fingers.
“It is just possible,” he said slowly, “that he went in somewhere
and bought a hat.”</p>

<p>“Of course he must have got a hat,” said Fay.</p>

<p>“It never occurred to either of us that he would do anything
so sane.”</p>

<p>“We never thought of asking in the hatters’ shops,” said
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Happily,” said Lambone, and turned to welcome his
refreshment. “That would have been the last straw.”</p>

<p>“For a long time we were on the trail of another hatless
man,” said Christina Alberta. “We ran him down in the
Essex Road after tracking him all up Pentonville. But he
was just a vegetarian in sandals and a beard. And there
was a report of a hatless man near the Britannia, but that
came to nothing. He seemed just to have come out of his
house somewhere to buy fried fish off a barrow in the
Camden Town High Street.”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary how a crowd collects when you ask the
simplest questions,” said Lambone with his mouth full of
sandwich. “And how urgently helpful it can be. They
almost forced us up a staircase after that fried-fish man,
who struck me as an extremely pugnacious, suspicious-looking
fellow. The crowd would have it we wanted him,
and he didn’t seem to want in the very least to be wanted.
If I hadn’t had an inspiration something very disagreeable
might have happened. I just said ‘No, it’s not this gentleman,
it’s another of the same name.’”</p>

<p>“But what did he say?”</p>

<p>“‘You <i>better</i>,’ he said. But anyhow it satisfied the crowd,
and afterwards we got away quite easily on an omnibus
that took us down to Portland Road Station.”</p>

<p>The champagne arrived in its ice pail. “Hardly cold, sir,
yet,” said the waiter, feeling the bottle.</p>

<p>“It’s not a time for fastidiousness,” said Lambone and
took a third sandwich. “You’re not eating, Christina
Alberta. And I insist upon your having at least one
glass of this.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta drank a little and ate mechanically.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we shall ever see him again,” said Harold.
“London is so vast. So <i>vast</i>! But I always feel that, when
I see anyone go out anywhere. There is a tremendous
courage in going out. London must be full of lost people.
I used to be afraid of London until I discovered the Tubes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and the Underground. I felt I might be sucked up side-streets
to God knows where. And keep on going round
corners into longer and longer streets for ever. I used to
dream of the last street of all—<i>endless</i>. But whenever I get
nervous I just ask for the nearest tube station and there
I am.”</p>

<p>“He <i>may</i> be back at the studio now,” said Fay.</p>

<p>Paul Lambone reached his fourth sandwich and his third
glass of champagne with great rapidity. He became more
leisurely in his refreshment.</p>

<p>“I am disappointed,” he said, “that I didn’t think of the
possibility of his buying a hat. It has disorganized all my
inductions. You see I was so concentrated on what was
going on inside his head that I never troubled about what
might be going on outside it. But a man of his neat and
proper habits—acquired through a lifetime of orderly
living—would get himself a hat almost mechanically....
We may have passed quite close to him in that.”</p>

<p>“I should have known him,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“But, until that Pentonville man drew a red herring across
the trail, I am convinced we were close on his footsteps.
You see Christina Alberta insisted upon my asking every
policeman we saw—even men, overworked, irritable,
snappy, <i>rude</i> men controlling the traffic—but at any rate I
chose the route—I inferred the route. You see, my dear
Watson”—he smiled faintly in weary self-approval at
Crumb—“the essential thing in a case like this is to put
yourself in your man’s place, to think his thoughts instead
of your own. That is what I tried—so far as being out of
breath would allow it—to impress on Christina Alberta.
It’s fairly straightforward. Here you have a man convinced,
beautifully and enviably convinced, that he is the
supreme lord of the world, unknown, unrecognized as yet,
but on the eve of his proclamation. Will such a man go
along any street just as easily as any other? Not at all!
He will be elated, expansive, ascendant. Very well; he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
go up hill and not down. He will choose wide highways
and not narrow ones and tend towards the middle of the
street——”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been run over!” cried Christina Alberta
sharply.</p>

<p>“No. No. He would avoid traffic because that
would hustle him and impair his dignity. Open spaces
would attract him. High buildings, bright lights, the intimations
of any assembly would draw him powerfully. So
he certainly crossed Trafalgar Square from the Admiralty
Arch in a diagonal direction, towards the conspicuous invitation
of the Coliseum.... You see my method?”</p>

<p>He did not wait for Crumb to answer. “But the more I
think over our missing friend,” he went on, “the more I
admire and envy him. What crawling things we are!—content
to be subjects, units, items, pawns, drops of water
and grains of sand, in the multitudinous, unmeaning muddle
of human affairs. He soars above it. He soars above it
now. He rejects his commonness and inferiority in one
magnificent gesture. <i>His</i> world. The grandeur of it!
Wherever he is to-night and whatever fate overtake him,
he is a happy man. And we sit here, we sit here and
drink—I am ordering another bottle of that wine, Harold,
and I expect you and Mrs. Crumb to abandon that warm
and sticky beer and join me—Waiter! Yes—another,
please—we sit here in this crowded, smoky gathering (<i>look</i>
at ’em!) while he plans the salvation of the world that we
let slide, and lifts his kingly will to God. Glorious exaltation!
Suppose that all of us could be touched——”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta interrupted. “I think we ought to telephone
to the hospitals. I didn’t think before of the possibility
of his being run over. Always he has been a little
careless at crossings.”</p>

<p>Paul Lambone lifted a deprecating hand and searched in
his mind for some excuse for rest.</p>

<p>“A little later,” he said after a slight pause, “the hospital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
staffs will be more at leisure. It is their rush hour now—ten
to eleven. Yes, the Rush Hour....”</p>

<h4>§ 9</h4>

<p>Teddy Winterton appeared wading through obstructive
seated people. His eye was fixed on Christina Alberta.
“Hullo!” said Lambone in not too cordial greeting, and
glanced at Christina Alberta and back at the new-comer.</p>

<p>Teddy struggled for an unoccupied chair over which
some lady had thrown a sealskin coat, and captured it with
profuse apologies to the owner of the cloak and squeezed
it in at the end of the table between Harold and Fay, who
barred his way to Christina Alberta. “Have pity on a
lonely man,” he said genially and tried to catch the eye of
Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“You shall have one glass of champagne,” said Lambone
with a slightly forced welcome in his tone.</p>

<p>“How do, Christina Alberta!” said Teddy forcing her
attention.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta turned to Fay. “Will you come back
with me now,” she said to her, “back to the flat? I must
do that telephoning to the hospitals now or it won’t
be done.”</p>

<p>Fay looked at her curiously. “It’s serious,” said Christina
Alberta’s eyes, and Fay stood up and struggled with
her coat. Teddy leaped to his feet to assist her. Christina
Alberta had not removed her cloak, and was ready. “I say,
Christina Alberta,” said Teddy. “I want a word with you.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Fay,” said Christina Alberta, giving her friend a
little dig in the back and pretending not to hear him.</p>

<p>Teddy followed them out to the Piccadilly pavement.
“Just a word,” he said. Fay was for standing a little way
off, but Christina Alberta would not let that happen.</p>

<p>“I don’t want a word,” she said.</p>

<p>“But I might help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“You might have done. But it’s too late. I never want
to see you again.”</p>

<p>“Give a fellow a chance.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had your chance. And tried to take it.”</p>

<p>“You might at least keep up appearances,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“Damn appearances!” said Christina Alberta. “Oh!
<i>Come</i> on, Fay.”</p>

<p>She gripped her friend’s arm.</p>

<p>Teddy was left hovering. He hesitated and then went
back into the café to rejoin Crumb and Lambone.</p>

<p>The two young women went on in silence for a little
while.</p>

<p>“Anything up?” Fay ventured.</p>

<p>“Everything’s up,” said Christina Alberta. “I wonder if
there’s a ghost of a chance of finding Daddy at the studio.”</p>

<p>They made their way to Chelsea without much further
conversation. Fay had never before seen Christina Alberta
looking tired.</p>

<p>When Fay opened the door Christina Alberta pushed
in past her. “Daddy!” she cried in the dark passage.
“Daddy!”</p>

<p>Fay clicked on the light. “No,” said Christina Alberta.
“Of course he’s not here. He’s gone. Fay! What am I to
<i>do</i>?”</p>

<p>Fay’s pale blue eyes became rounder. Christina Alberta,
the valiant, the modern, was in tears.</p>

<p>“There’s the hospitals,” said Fay, doing her best to be
brisk and cheerful.</p>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">M<small>R. PREEMBY</small> had disappeared from Christina Alberta’s
world. For a time he must disappear almost as
completely from this story. Mr. Preemby fades out.
Taking over his outward likeness we have now to tell of
another and greater person, Sargon the First, the Magnificent
One, King of all Kings, the Inheritor of the Earth.</p>

<p>It is no doubt a very wonderful and glorious thing to
discover that instead of being the rather obscure widower
of a laundry proprietor with no particular purpose in the
world one is Lord of the Whole World, but it is also, to a
conscientious man anxious to do right, an extremely disturbing
and oppressive discovery. And at first it is natural
that there should be something a little confusing to the
mind in this vast and glittering idea. It was an idea that
carried with it an effect of release and enlargement. For
purposes as yet obscure, he had been caught like a caged
creature in that limited and uninteresting Preemby life.
His imagination had rebelled against its finality; some
deep instinct had warned him that his life was an illusion;
in moments of reverie, and sometimes between sleeping and
waking, there had been intimations of a light and purpose
beyond the apparent reality. Now abruptly, as though a
portal swung open, as though a curtain was drawn, that
light poured upon him dazzlingly. His was no single life
that begins and ends and is done with like an empty song.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
His existence was like a thread that shone and vanished and
returned in the unending fabric of being; that was woven
into a purpose. In the past he had been Porg in the city
of Kleb, and he had been Sargon and Belshazzar. Many
others had he been, but those memories still slumbered
under the dark waters of forgetfulness. But the memory
of Sargon shone bright. It was his Sargon self that had
returned and no other of his selves. For some reason that
was still obscure the Power that ruled his life needed him
to be Sargon once again, in this great distressful world of
to-day. Sargon had begun life humbly as an outcast babe
and had risen to restore and rule and extend a mightier
Empire than the old world had ever seen before. Certain
qualities (h’rrmp) had been displayed by Sargon, and because
of these qualities the Power had called upon him
again.</p>

<p>A whole series of memories was unfolding in his mind.
With an extraordinary convincingness he recalled his youth,
memories of those distant days in Sumeria where the
Power had set him on high. They were so bright and so
pleasing that already they were thrusting his recollections
of Sheringham and Woodford Wells into the background,
making a fading phantom of his Preemby existence. He
had never cherished these latter experiences, never turned
them over in his mind with any pleasure. But his newly-restored
memories were memories to dwell upon. There
were pictures of his early life when he was a foundling,
a mysterious foundling at the court of his predecessor.
(That predecessor’s name still escaped him.) Young
Sargon was a fair and blue-eyed youth, a thing rare in
brown Sumeria, and he had been found floating down the
great river in a little cradle boat of rushes and bitumen,
and he had been taken and adopted by the ruler of the
land. And already as a lad he was pointed out as having
an exceptional wisdom, as being able to do what other men
could not do, he had the genius of the ruler. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
that he had great cleverness nor great skill nor strength.
Many of those about him excelled him in these minor
things—in cleverness and memory work in particular,
Prewm, the son of the Grand Vizier, excelled him—but he
had the true, the kingly wisdom beyond them all.</p>

<p>“The true, the kingly wisdom,” said Mr. Preemby-Sargon
aloud and came into sharp collision with a tall, dark gentleman
hurrying from St. James’s Park towards St. James’s
Palace. “Sorry!” cried Mr. Preemby-Sargon.</p>

<p>“My fault,” said the tall, dark gentleman. “Late for an
appointment.” And swept on.</p>

<p>Odd! Where had Mr. Preemby—or Sargon—seen that
face before? Could it be—Something connected it
vaguely with Sheringham and sunlit sand. And then
Sumeria came uppermost and the tall, dark gentleman became
the chieftain of a desert tribe, a desert tribe amidst
the sands.</p>

<p>The ruffled surface became calm again, and that boyhood
in Sumeria resumed possession of the mirror. Where were
we? Even in those early days men had marked a gravity
in the lad beyond his years. He had avoided puerile games.
In all his lives he had avoided puerile games. No cricketer
even at Sheringham. Modestly but firmly this youth had
raised his voice in the council chamber and his words were
seen to be wisdom. The old men had sat around marvelling.
“He sayeth Sooth,” they said in their antique Sumerian
way. A soothsayer. He was also called the Young
Pathfinder.</p>

<p>Before Sargon was fifteen the old childless ruler, beset
by enemies, threatened with plots, had marked him. “This
boy might save the state.” Then, while yet only a few
days over eighteen he was given charge of an expedition to
pacify the mountain folk of the north and persuade them
not to ally themselves with the Enemy of the North. He
did more than he was told to do. He went through the
mountain land into the plains beyond, and gave battle to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the Enemy of the North and defeated him and smote him
severely. After that all men perceived that he must be the
new Lord and Master of Sumeria, the successor of his aged
Patron. All applauded with sincerity except Prewm the
Clever (already adorned with precocious sprouting
whiskers) and he applauded with envy in his eyes. And
then came the days of the Succession, and the Inauguration
of the Harem, beautiful days. And after that the birth of
the Princess Royal, his only child, and that great expedition
into the deserts of the south. And more expeditions
and great law-makings, wise laws and wiser, and crowds
of applauding, grateful people and happy villages. Life
became happy universally. Prewm plotted and rebelled
and was dealt with after the simple custom of the time.
That was a regrettable necessity, a thing not to be dwelt
upon. The frontiers spread and the great peace spread;
Russia, Turkey in Europe, Persia, India, Ancient Egypt,
Somaliland, and so on and so forth, were conquered and
made happy. America and Australia and the remains of
Atlantis, still not completely submerged, were discovered.
They were forgotten again afterwards, but they were really
discovered then—and paid tribute. A League of Nations
was established.</p>

<p>All the world told of the goodness of Sargon and lived
golden days. For Sargon ruled by the light of justice in
his heart. He mitigated the sacrifices in the Temples and
introduced a kind of Protestantism into the creeds and
services. The people made songs praising him. Passing
men and women would run to kiss his hand. Nor did he
deny himself to his people. That confidence was his end.
Came alas! the assassin’s knife, the black assassin, a
madman, a stranger——!</p>

<p>It was wonderful. He could remember his people
mourning after he was dead.</p>

<p>The white glove of a policeman against Mr. Preemby-Sargon’s
chest just saved him from stepping in front of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
motor ’bus. He recoiled dexterously. He was in Trafalgar
Square, a great meeting-place, a confluence. Here in the
warm light of the October afternoon was a crowd even
greater than the Sumerian crowds. Here he would observe
them. They were dark crowds, anxious-faced crowds. His
coming back had to do with them. There had been a great
war, much devastation; the world was wounded and unable
to recover. The poor rulers and politicians of this age
had no wisdom, had no instinct for the fundamentally right
thing. Once more a leader and a saviour was required,
one who had the wisdom that counts.</p>

<p>It was Sargon that walked under the noses of Nelson’s
lions and made his way past the statue of George the
Fourth to the balustrading that commands the square. He
took up his position there for a long survey. He looked
down Whitehall to the great tower of the Houses of Parliament
and Whitehall was full of a golden haze set with a
glitter of traffic. The stream of omnibuses, cars, and
motor vans poured up to mingle with the streams that
came out of Northumberland Avenue and the Strand, and
the joint flow sundered again to the left of him and to
the right away to Pall Mall, across the square there. No
street lamps were lit as yet, but in the rounded bluffs of
building to the left a few windows were warm with lights.
Below, across the square, thin streams of pedestrians flowed
like ants from one point to another and the squat little
station of the Tube Railway perpetually swallowed up
dots and clumps of individuals. Some sort of meeting was
going on at the foot of the Nelson column, a mere knot of
people without evident enthusiasm. Men with white and
red placards about Unemployment were distributing white
handbills and shaking collecting boxes. Immediately underneath
a few poorly-dressed children ran about and played
and squabbled....</p>

<p>Just a little patch this was in one of his cities. For, you
see, by the lapse of time and the development of his ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
empire, he was the rightful owner and ruler of this city
and of every other city in the world.</p>

<p>And he had come back to heal the swarming world’s
disorders and reinstate the deep peace of old Sumeria
once again.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>But how to set about this task?</p>

<p>That was the difficulty. There must be no Half Advent.
He must take hold swiftly and decisively he realized, and
from the balustrading in front of the National Gallery it
looked a large, loose, scattering sort of world to take hold
of. It might refuse to be taken hold of. If he began now,
if he began to shout from this place, it was more than
likely that no one would heed him. He must watch warily
for his opportunity and <i>make no mistakes</i>. It did not
become the Lord and Restorer of the Whole Earth to make
mistakes.</p>

<p>Now, for example, that had nearly been a mistake at
Buckingham Palace. It had blown over all right but it
might have had serious consequences. People did not
know the Master yet, had no inkling. “They might,” said
Sargon, lapsing into a Preemby homeliness “have run me
in. And a Pretty Fool I should have looked then!”</p>

<p>There must be no more hasty action of that sort.</p>

<p>No. Indeed it became him rather to wait for guidance.</p>

<p>The Power that had brought him back into the world and
awakened him to a sense of his true identity and his
mission, might be trusted presently to send him an enlightened
supporter or so—who would recognize him. Because,
of course, he must resemble the monarch he had been—even
as Hockleby had been recognizably like Prewm. As
he weighed this thought his hand sought his moustache
and he twisted it thoughtfully. It was in effect a disguise.
Meanwhile—? Meanwhile he must see what he could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
determine the mood of the people and learn their particular
needs and distresses. He could go among his people
unsuspected—like Haroun al Raschid, but for a wiser
purpose....</p>

<p>“Haroun al Raschid,” whispered Sargon and looked up to
Lord Nelson and nodded to him in a friendly way.
“Haroun al Raschid. Would that my pocket was full of
pieces of gold! But of that to-morrow. That man—what
was his name?—Preemby had a bank somewhere.”</p>

<p>He felt for his breast pocket. The cheque-book was
still there. One signed the cheques “<i>A. E. Preemby</i>”—queer,
but one did. This A. E. Preemby had played the
part of a chrysalis. His hoard remained.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>In the Strand his Majesty caught a glimpse of his
reflection in a shop window. His hair was a little disordered,
and he disliked to have his hair disordered. He went
into a hat shop that presented itself conveniently and
bought himself a hat.</p>

<p>He took out his little note-case to pay—a reassuring
thing to do. For in it were no less than seven pound-notes.
He counted them with satisfaction. After paying up at
Tunbridge he had drawn again on his bank. He hesitated
whether he should give largesse to the shopman—and did
not do so.</p>

<p>It was not another grey felt hat with a black ribbon
he bought; it was an exceptional felt hat with a large brim
such as an artist or a literary personage might have chosen.
It was not the hat that Albert Edward Preemby, the restrained,
the hesitating, would have bought; it was much
more Sargon’s sort of hat. Yet not pure Sargonesque;
there was a touch of disguise about it still, a more manifest
disguise. The brim came down over one’s brow. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
could see ever and again in shop windows and incidental
mirrors that now a shadow of mystery lay upon those
brooding blue eyes.</p>

<p>He made his way eastward towards Aldwych and so into
Kingsway, looking now at the shops, now scanning the
faces of the people.</p>

<p>To-day he was The Unknown. Scarce a soul that gave
him a second glance. But soon would come discovery and
then all this careless jostling crowd would be magnetized
as he passed, would turn with one accord to him. They
would salute and whisper and wonder. And he must be
ready for them, ready to guide their destinies forthwith.
It would not do to stand at a loss and say “Er,” to stand
collecting his thoughts and clear his throat, “H’rrmp.”</p>

<p>Terrible the responsibility that lay upon him! But he
would not shirk it. What should be his opening words
to them when the moment of revelation came? “First;—Let
there be Peace!” Better words than that one could
not imagine. He muttered to himself; “Peace and not
War among the Nations. Peace and not War among individuals.
Peace in the street—in the workroom—in the shop.
<i>Peace</i>.</p>

<p>“Love and Peace. I, Sargon the Magnificent, command
it. I, Sargon, have come back after many ages to give
Peace to the Whole World.”</p>

<p>A shop window drew him. It was a map shop and
prominently displayed in the window was a map of
<i>Europe after the Treaty of Versailles:—Two and Sixpence.</i>
He stood looking at that. It would all have to be altered
again. That was just part of his task. Then he surveyed
the rest of the window. Behind the map of Europe there
hung a wall-map of the world. He would need such a
map of the world; you cannot rule the world without a
map of it. Or you may forget large portions. Or would
a globe be better? Maps are all to be seen at once, and
besides they are more portable. Furthermore, the shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
did not seem to sell globes and he did not know where
globes were to be bought. He went in and bought the
world map and emerged again on Kingsway after an
interval, with a roll four feet long under his arm. He was
also carrying an ingenious flat-paper planisphere which
had caught his fancy as he stood at the counter. It might
be useful, he felt, for astrological purposes.</p>

<p>He began to think vaguely of his possible destination.
Whither was he going?</p>

<p>He was seeking quarters, he was seeking indeed some
lonely hermitage. He had slipped away from the Princess
Royal, who also had come back—rather needlessly he
thought—into this modern world, because it was necessary
for him to be absolutely alone for a time. He had to spend
some days or weeks in spiritual struggle and meditation
and mental purification before his revelation came. Even
she might not minister to him during that period. She
was devoted, but she hampered him. Indeed, she hampered
him greatly. She did not fully understand. Her remarks
and questions were generally disconcerting and sometimes
downright annoying. It was quite probable that the metamorphosis
might never occur with her about. And, besides,
always in the history of great Visitants and marvellous
returns there had been this opening phase of withdrawal
and self-communion. Buddha, Muhammad; they had
all done it. Perhaps he would fast. Perhaps fasting
would be necessary. Perhaps there would be Celestial
Visitants.</p>

<p>He wished he knew more of the technique of fasting.
Did one just stop having meals or were there ceremonies
and precautions? But of that later. First he had to find
that quiet room, his secret place of final preparation.</p>

<p>Presently he found himself in the grey squares of
Bloomsbury and every house he passed displayed in its
window a genteel card offering “Apartments” or “Bed and
Breakfast.” Here also were “Private Hotels” and even a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
plain “Boarding House.” Well, here no doubt it had to be.
A simple room amidst his unsuspecting people, a simple,
simply furnished room.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>But through all Bloomsbury, to judge by the dark green
and silver cards in its ground-floor windows, was offering
shelter and sustenance to the homeless and the stranger,
the new Lord of the World found it no easy matter to
secure that simple room he needed for his own use. For
more than an hour he was visiting one grey house after
another, knocking, standing on doorsteps, entering passages
laid with immemorial oilcloth, and demanding a
sight of the accommodation offered, inspecting it, asking
prices—and—it became more and more evident—arousing
suspicion. The people stared at his rolled-up map and
his planisphere and seemed to dislike them instinctively.
He had not expected such blunt demands for information;
his vague mysteriousness was swept aside, he found himself
difficult to explain. They wanted to know how he was
occupied and when he would like to move in. None of
them seemed prepared for him to just sit down in his
room there and then. They expected him to go out and
fetch his luggage. It undermined his confidence that
behind him there was no luggage. All these people, he
realized more and more distinctly, would expect him to
produce luggage and might behave unreasonably if he did
not do so. A mere readiness to pay in advance, he
gathered, was not enough for them.</p>

<p>He had counted upon finding kind and simple people
behind these lodging-house doors, people who would accept
him and look up to him from the first and wonder about
him and his planisphere, speculate about its significance
and gradually realize the marvellous visitant that had come
to them. But the people he saw were not simple people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Mostly they were dingy, sophisticated people. They
came up out of basements in a mood of sceptical
scrutiny, men in shirt sleeves, morose for the most part
and generally ill-shaven; extremely knowing and anything
but virginal young women, grimy looking older women,
hungrily lean or unwholesomely fat. One had a goitre-like
growth. And always there was something defensive in
their manner.</p>

<p>And the rooms he saw were even less simple than the
people. His consciousness was invaded by a sense of the
vast moral changes that had happened to the world since
he had ruled the white-robed honesty of his Sumerian
irrigators. Then a room would have a table, a seat or two,
a shelf with a few phials, an image or suchlike religious
object, a clay tablet and a writing style, perhaps, if the
occupant was educated. But these rooms were encumbered
with contradictions. They had windows to let in the light
and dark curtains to keep it out. Sargon’s hidden second
youth in the laundry had made him very sensitive to dirtiness,
and the cotton-lace curtains of those places were
generally very dirty indeed. Electric light was still rare
in “apartments”; mostly they were lit from gas brackets
that descended from the centre of the ceiling and carried
globes of frosted and cut glass. Always there was a considerable
table in the centre and two uneasy arm-chairs.
And there were lumpish sideboards of shiny, liver-coloured
wood and comfortless sofas and incredible ornaments.
Sometimes the rooms, and particularly the bedrooms, had
a meretricious smartness and gaiety with mezzotints of
ladies in the natural state trying to pass themselves off as
allegorical figures or of the Baths in the congested harems
of wealthy, rather than refined, Orientals. The over-mantels
were extraordinary affairs and much loaded with
crockery ornaments, little jars, small gilt-winged angels,
red devils, or encouraging looking ladies in bathing-dresses
that were too tight for them. A common form of decoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
was to fasten up plates on the wall much as one sees vermin
nailed up on a barn.</p>

<p>A considerable number of these homes for hire were as
shabby as roadside tramps. One stood out in his memory
as faded and dusty and grey and threadbare beyond the
possibility of reality. His self-absorption was penetrated
by the wonder of who could live and who could have
lived in such quarters. All his life had been amongst
clean and bright surroundings; it was rare that he had
any glimpses of that worn and weary stratum of English
town life in which things are patched indeed, but in
which it is rare for anything to be mended or cleaned and
incredible that anything should be replaced. Even the
air in these rooms seemed long out of date and the glass
over the rusty engravings of the Monarch of the Glen
and the Stag at Bay spotted by remote ancestral flies.</p>

<p>“Does anyone ever stay here?” asked Sargon of the
shattered-looking lady in charge.</p>

<p>He did not realize the cruelty of his question until he
had asked it.</p>

<p>“My last gentleman stayed here fifteen years,” said the
shattered lady. “He was a copying clerk. He died in
hospital this June. Dropsy. He always found this very
satisfactory—<i>very</i> satisfactory. I never knew him complain.
He was a very good friend to me.”</p>

<p>A great desire for fresh air came upon Sargon. “How
much are these rooms?” he asked. “I must think it over.
Think it over and let you know.”</p>

<p>She asked her price, the usual price in that street, but
as she led the way down to the door she said: “If it’s too
much—If you made an offer, sir——”</p>

<p>Despair looked out of her grime-rimmed eyes.</p>

<p>“I must think about it,” said Sargon and was once more
at large.</p>

<p>Why did people get so dirty and dismal and broken
down? Surely in Sumeria there were never lives like that!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
It would have to be altered; all this would have to be
altered when the Kingdom came.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Then as the twilight deepened Sargon discovered just
the peaceful room he desired. It announced itself hopefully
not by the usual printed card but by a hand-written
tablet saying “A Room to Let,” in a window that had no
lace curtains but little purple ones enhancing rather than
concealing a bare-looking white room lit pleasantly by the
flickering of a fire. There were one or two pictures—real
coloured pictures—hanging on the white wall. Rather
wearily Sargon lifted the knocker and supplemented its
appeal by pressing the electric bell.</p>

<p>There was no immediate answer, and he knocked a
second time before the door opened. A slender young man
appeared holding a small girl perched on his shoulder.
She regarded Sargon gravely with very dark grey-blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“Everybody seems to have gone out,” said the slender
young man in a very pleasant voice. “What can I do
for you?”</p>

<p>“You have a room to let,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“There <i>is</i> a room to let here, yes,” said the slender young
man and his appreciative dark eyes took in the details
of the figure in front of him.</p>

<p>“Could I see it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he might <i>see</i> it, Susan,” the young man hesitated.</p>

<p>“Of course the gem’s got to see it,” said the small girl.
“If Mrs. Richman was here she’d show it him fast enough,
old stoopid.” And she pulled the slender young man’s
hair—affectionately but very, very hard.</p>

<p>“You see,” the young man explained. “The landlady is
out. <i>Don’t</i>, Susan. And the landlady’s lady assistant is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
out, too. Every one is out—and we’re sort of unofficially
left in charge somehow. Properly, I ought not to have
answered the door.”</p>

<p>“But I told you to—<i>silly</i>!” said the little girl.</p>

<p>The young man made no definite move. Instead, he
asked a question. “Is that a map, sir, you are carrying?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“It is a map of the world,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“Very helpful I should think, sir. And so you found
your way here. Well—The room’s upstairs if you’d
come up. Hold tight, Susan, and try not to strangle me.”
And he led the way up the staircase.</p>

<p>It was just the usual staircase and hall with oilcloth
and wall-paper to imitate some exceptionally bilious
coarse-grained wood. As they ascended the young lady
ran great risks in her resolution never to take her eyes
off Sargon and his map. She twisted round a complete
circle and forced her bearer to stop on the first landing
and readjust her. “If you pull my hair once more,” said
the slender young man, “I shall put you down and never,
never, never give you a ride again. It’s on the next floor,
sir, if you’d go first.”</p>

<p>The room appeared delightfully free from unnecessary
furnishings. There was a little plain bed, a table under
the window, and a gas-stove, and the walls were papered
in brown paper, adorned with commonplace but refreshing
Japanese colour prints. There was a recess one side of the
fire-place with three empty shelves painted like the mantelpiece,
a deep blue. The young man had clicked on an
electric light, which was pleasantly shaded.</p>

<p>“It’s rather plain,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“I like it,” said Sargon. “I have no use for superfluities.”</p>

<p>“It used to be my room,” said the young man, “but
now I share the dining-room floor with the people downstairs
and I’ve given this up. It’s rather on my conscience——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“People downstairs—what people downstairs? There
aren’t no People downstairs. It’s Daddy and Mummy
he means,” said the young lady.</p>

<p>“It’s rather on my conscience,” said the young man,
“that I persuaded Mrs. Richman to alter the furniture.
It isn’t to everybody’s taste.”</p>

<p>“May I ask,” said Sargon, “how much the room might
be?”</p>

<p>“Thirty shillings, I <i>believe</i>,” said the young man, “with
breakfasts.”</p>

<p>Sargon put down his map and the planisphere upon the
table. He felt that he must secure this room or be for
ever defeated.</p>

<p>“I am willing,” he said, “to take the room. I would pay
for it in advance. And take up my quarters at once. But,
I must warn you, my position in the world is peculiar.
I give no reference, I bring no luggage.”</p>

<p>“Except of course these charts,” said the young man.
“Haven’t you—for instance—a toothbrush?”</p>

<p>Sargon thought. “No. I must get myself a toothbrush.”</p>

<p>“I think it would <i>look</i> better,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“If necessary,” said Sargon, “I will pay for two weeks in
advance. And I will get myself all necessary things.”</p>

<p>The young man regarded him with an affectionate expression.
“If it was my room I should let you have it like
a shot,” he said. “But Mrs. Richman is the landlady and
in many respects she’s different from me. Have you—travelled
far, sir?”</p>

<p>“In space,” said Sargon, “<i>No</i>.”</p>

<p>“But in time, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“In time, yes. But I would rather not enter into explanations
at present.”</p>

<p>The young man’s interest and amusement deepened. He
put Susan down on her feet. “Might I look at your
map?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Willingly,” said Sargon. He unrolled the map on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
table and put his finger on London. “We are here,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said the young man, helping to hold the map
on the table from which it seemed likely to slip.</p>

<p>“It is still the most convenient centre in the world,” said
Sargon.</p>

<p>“For almost any purpose,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“For mine, yes,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“And that star thing—that must be a great help?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“I suppose you would—<i>work</i> in the room? It would be
just yourself? There would be no coming and going of
people?”</p>

<p>“None. While I was here, no one would know me. Afterwards
perhaps. But that does not concern us. Here I
should remain incognito.”</p>

<p>“Incognito,” the young man repeated, as though he considered
the word. “Of course. Naturally. By the by,
sir, might I ask your name? (If you hit me again, Susan,
I shall do something cruel and dreadful to you.) We’d
have to know your name.”</p>

<p>“For the time I think Mr.—Mr. Sargon.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the young man, “for the time. Sargon—wasn’t
that an Assyrian king, or does my memory betray
me?”</p>

<p>“It is not the Assyrian Sargon in this case, it is the Sumerian
Sargon, his predecessor.”</p>

<p>“Not a word more, sir—I understand. You must be
fatigued after your long journey and I should love—I
should dearly love to let you the room. <i>Wow!</i> Susan,
you go downstairs. Pinching I can’t stand. Come along.
You go down to your own proper room and let’s have no
nonsense about it. <i>Come!</i>”</p>

<p>Susan backed to the wall and prepared to resist tooth
and nail. “I didn’t <i>mean</i> to pinch, Bobby,” she said. “I
didn’t mean to pinch. Troof and really! I was just feelin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
your trousis. Oh, don’t take me down, Bobby! Don’t take
me down. I <i>will</i> be good! I’ll be awful good. I’ll just stay
here and look at the funny geman. If you take me down,
Bobby——”</p>

<p>“Now, is this a real reformation, Susan—a conversion, a
change of heart? Will you be a <i>jeune femme rangée</i> and
all that, if I forgive you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be anyfing, Bobby dear, flet me stay.”</p>

<p>“Well! cease to exist then—for all practical purposes and
I’ll forgive you. What can the nice gentleman think of
you, Susan? And you more than five! <i>Bah!</i> We were
saying, Mr. Sargon—? Yes, of course, I was saying that
you ought to take the room. Payment in advance will be
accepted. <i>But</i>—there is that toothbrush. And other small—what
shall I say?—realistic touches. <i>I</i> shouldn’t mind
personally, but I’m only an agent, so to speak. Properly
I am a sort of writer. Properly I ought to be writing a
novel now, but, as you see, Mrs. Richman has left the
house on my hands and my friends downstairs have left
this charming young lady on my hands—Put that tongue
back at once, Susan. Unladylike child!—and here we are!
But as I’m saying, Mrs. Richman is the principal. She
has her fancies about lodgers. It is useless to dispute
about them. She will want a show of luggage. She will
insist. But that is really not an insurmountable difficulty.
This—you will remember the name?—is Nine Midgard
Street. If you go out from here and turn to the left, take
the third to the right and go straight on, you will come to
a main thoroughfare full of ’buses and trams and traffic
and light and noise, and at the corner you will find a shop
where they sell second-hand trunks and bags. Now if you
bought an old, battered, largish bag—and then went across
the road to a chemist’s shop and got those washing things
you need—Oh! and a reserve collar or so at the outfitter’s
next door—You <i>must</i> get such things.... You see the
idea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Sargon stood in front of the unlit gas-stove. “This seems
to be acting a falsehood.”</p>

<p>“But you must have clean collars sometimes,” protested
the young man.</p>

<p>“I admit that,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“And then you can settle down here and tell me about
that business of yours. Otherwise, you know, you’ll just
wander about.”</p>

<p>“Your suggestion is really quite a helpful one,” said
Sargon, getting the thing into focus. “I shall adopt
it.”</p>

<p>“You won’t lose the way back?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Nine Midgard Street.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember.”</p>

<p>“Queer world it is,” said the young man; “isn’t it? How
did you leave the old folks in—Sumeria?”</p>

<p>“My people were happy,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“Exactly. I’ve been there since. <i>Quite</i> recently. But
the weather wasn’t good and I got knocked about by a
shell and had a nasty time as a wounded prisoner. Hot.
Crowded. No shelter. Nothing cool to drink. But in
your time it was different.”</p>

<p>“Very,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“And now—by Jove! that kettle is boiling over all by this
time, Susan. Come down to my room, such as it is, and
have a cup of tea, sir. And then you can go out and make
those little arrangements of yours and dig yourself in so
to speak before Mrs. Richman comes back. This, by the
by, is your gas meter. You get gas by the shilling in the
slot arrangement.”</p>

<p>“You are being very, very helpful to me,” said Sargon.
“It shall not be forgotten when my time comes.”</p>

<p>“Nothing. It just happened you came into my hands so
to speak. No, Susan, we don’t. You <i>walk</i> downstairs.
Pinching is forgiven but not forgotten. You can leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
your map, sir—and that star thing—as visible signs of
your occupation. No, Susan—on foot.”</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>The young man’s room was bookish and rather untidy,
and Susan had been killing toys on the carpet—a china-headed
doll and something or other of yellow painted wood
appeared to be the chief victims. The doll had bled sawdust
profusely. Dark curtains were drawn and a green-shaded
electric light threw all the apartment into darkness
except the floor. There was a gas-fire with a gas-ring on
which a boiling kettle steamed like an excited volcano;
there was a deal table on which was a big pile of letters
address to “<i>Aunt Suzannah</i>” c/o Editor of <i>Wilkins’ Weekly</i>,
and there was a large untidy desk on which was another
litter of letters evidently receiving attention, and in the
midst of the desk a writing-pad, on which reposed a
squeezable tube of liquid glue and a half-mended toy.
The glue oozed upon the face sheet of the writing-pad
beneath these words, written in a beautifully neat handwriting:</p>

<p class="center">UPS AND DOWNS<br>
<br>
<i>A Pedestrian Novel</i><br>
<br>
<small>BY ROBERT ROOTHING</small><br>
<br>
CHAPTER THE FIRST<br>
<br>
<small>WHICH INTRODUCES OUR HERO</small></p>

<p>Beyond that the novel did not seem to have progressed.</p>

<p>With the dexterity of long-established usage Bobby made
tea and produced plum-bread and butter. Meanwhile he
kept a wary eye on Susan who had sat down by the waste-paper
basket and was tearing up paper, and attended to
the remarks and attitudes of his remarkable visitor.</p>

<p>Sargon already liked this young man enormously. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
extremely reassuring and encouraging to meet such kindly
acceptance and understanding after the chill and doubt
and ugliness of the previous hour’s experiences. And it
was nice and refreshing to have tea. A sort of grey insecurity,
a threat of suppression that had come over his
mind, vanished in this genial atmosphere. The shrivelled
incognito expanded. The hidden mystery beneath it grew
rich and full once more. This young man—he seemed
ready to believe anything. Sargon walked up and down
with his hands behind his back as if in the profoundest
meditation. He would have muttered a few phrases in
Sumerian, but for some reason he had quite forgotten
that forgotten tongue.</p>

<p>“And so you write books?” he said regally.</p>

<p>“Not books,” Bobby answered over his shoulder; he was
now toasting a circle of plum-bread. “Not books <i>yet</i>.
But—it <i>is</i> ridiculous, isn’t it?—I am a bit of a poet and
all that sort of thing, and a journalist of sorts. Just
answers to correspondents—laborious, but a living.” He
indicated the piles of letters on the deal table. “As for
books—I have as a matter of fact <i>started</i> a novel—it’s
on that desk—but that’s only in the last few days. And
it’s so difficult to get a lot of time to oneself to really let
oneself go with it.”</p>

<p>“Inspiration,” said Sargon understandingly.</p>

<p>“Well, one must let oneself go a bit, I suppose; particularly
at first. But there’s always something one must do
cropping up to prevent it.”</p>

<p>“With me also.”</p>

<p>“No doubt.”</p>

<p>“That is why,” said Sargon, “I am withdrawing into this
solitude. To collect my forces. In Sumeria it was always
the practice, before any great undertaking, to go out
into the wilderness for a certain tale of days.”</p>

<p>“If I go out into the wilderness I get so lonely in the
evenings,” said Bobby. “<i>Ssh!</i> That was the front door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>He went out upon the staircase and stood listening.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Richman,” Sargon heard him call.</p>

<p>“S’me,” said a lady’s voice.</p>

<p>“Here’s a lodger for the second-floor front.”</p>

<p>“I bin to the pictures,” said the voice outside. “Mary
and Doug—a fair treat.”</p>

<p>A corpulent lady in a black bonnet appeared breathing
heavily. She panted a few obvious questions and
Bobby hovered helpfully at Sargon’s elbow to prevent
him making any mistakes. “He’ll pay in advance,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>“That’s awright,” said Mrs. Richman. “When will he
move in?”</p>

<p>“He’s getting his luggage right away,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s all right,” said Mrs. Richman.</p>

<p>“I know his people. At least I know about them. I’ve
been in his part of the country. You can be quite sure he’s
all right,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Well, if <i>you</i> say so,” said Mrs. Richman. “’Ope you’ll
be comfortable, Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sargon.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sargon.”</p>

<p>And after a few rather vague comments on the weather
Mrs. Richman withdrew. “And now,” said Bobby, “I’ll
just unload Susan on her and come with you for that
bag. It’s extraordinary how people lose their way in
London at times.”</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>“I’ve let the second-floor front to a lunatic,” said Bobby,
breaking the news to his ground-floor friends, Mr. and
Mrs. Malmesbury.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>Bobby</i>! and with Susan about!” cried Mrs. Malmesbury
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“But he’s a quite <i>harmless</i> lunatic, Tessy—and he had to
be taken in somewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“But a lunatic!” said Mrs. Malmesbury.</p>

<p>“I only said that for effect,” said Bobby. “He’s really
morbidly sane. I wouldn’t have let him go for anything.
Some day when I really get to work on that novel I’ll
put him in. I <i>must</i> have material, Tessy. And he’s
wonderful.”</p>

<p>He was preparing supper for the Malmesburys and himself.
He was frying some sausages and potatoes over a gas-ring.
Previously Bobby had done most of the putting of
Susan to bed, and he had sat and told her stories according
to custom until she was fast asleep. Tessy Malmesbury
was out of sorts; she had a neuralgic headache, Billy
Malmesbury had taken her for a walk in Regent’s Park
and she had come home exhausted; things would have
gone to pieces badly if Bobby had not taken them in hand.</p>

<p>Tessy was never very well nowadays; she was a slight
and fragile little thing and Susan had been a violent and
aggressive child long before she was born. In the long-lost
days before the war when Bobby had seen Tessy
first she had been the lightest, daintiest, most perfect thing
imaginable; he had compared her to a white petal drifting
down through sunlight, and almost written a poem about
her; he had loved her tremendously. But it had seemed
to him impossible to make love to so exquisite a being,
and Billy Malmesbury, who was less scrupulous, had
slipped in front of him and married her; she had not
appreciated the delicacy of not making love to her. And
then came the war and wounds and here they all were
again, fagged and near the thirties, in a world where their
small annuities brought them far less than they had
promised to do. Billy was the junior partner of an
architect and much encumbered with drawing-boards. He
was a large-framed young man with a big, round, good-looking,
slightly astonished face, pleasantly dappled with
freckles. He had a great protective affection for Bobby.
He sat now and designed a new sort of labour-saving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
pantry and, with a sense of infinite protection, let Bobby
get the meal.</p>

<p>“And now I can tell you,” said Bobby, when at last all
three of them were sitting at table.</p>

<p>“It’s a little dear of a lunatic,” he said. “If it’s a lunatic
at all.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t,” said Tessy.</p>

<p>“He’s quite tidy in his person and he hangs together—mentally
he hangs together—and his eyes aren’t in the
least wild. A leetle too bright and open perhaps. But
he <i>does</i> think the world belongs to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, Susan does that,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“And so does Billy,” said Tessy.</p>

<p>“But not quite with the same air of magnificent responsibility.
You see he thinks he’s a certain Mesopotamian
monarch called Sargon—I’ve heard of him because we
had a little dust-up with the Turks round and about his
stamping ground—he thinks he’s this Sargon come again
and come somehow—that bit’s a little difficult—into the
empire of the whole earth. It was Sargon, you know,
who started all these British Lions and Imperial Eagles
in the world. And so he proposes to take possession of
the planet, which is in such a frightful mess——”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“And put it in order.”</p>

<p>“What more simple?” cried Tessy.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Why haven’t we <i>all</i> thought of that?” said
Billy.</p>

<p>“But where does he come from?” asked Tessy.</p>

<p>“Not a sign. He might be a suburban nurseryman or
a small draper or something of that sort. I can’t place
him. One or two phrases he used suggested a house-agent.
But he may have picked them up from advertisements.
And his first proceeding—perfectly rational—was to buy
a map of the world. Naturally if you are going to rule
the world, you ought to have a map of it handy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Has he any money?”</p>

<p>“Enough to pay his way. He’s got a small note-case.
That seems to be all right. After we’d got a bag for him—he
hadn’t any luggage, and I thought he’d better buy a bag
to satisfy Mrs. Richman—we sat down upstairs and had
a simple straightforward talk about the world and what
had to be done with it. Most instructive.”</p>

<p>Bobby helped himself to some more fried potatoes.</p>

<p>“And what <i>is</i> going to be done with it?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Bobby; “it’s quite an attractive little
programme. Rather I think on the lines of the Labour
programme. Only simpler and more thorough. The Distinction
of Rich and Poor is to be Abolished Altogether.
Women are to be Freed from all Disadvantages. There is
to be No More War. He gets at the roots of things every
time.”</p>

<p>“If those are the roots,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“But isn’t the real question how to do it?” asked Tessy,
“Aren’t we all agreed about those things—in theory?”</p>

<p>“In theory, yes,” said Bobby. “But not in reality. If
every one really wanted to abolish the difference of rich
and poor it would be as easy as pie to find a way. There’s
always a way to everything if you want to do it enough.
But nobody really wants to do these things. Not as we
want meals. All sorts of other things people want, but
wanting to have no rich and poor any more isn’t real
wanting; it is just a matter of pious sentiment. And so it
is about war. We don’t want to be poor and we don’t
want to be hurt or worried by war, but that’s not wanting
to end those things. <i>He</i> wants to end them.”</p>

<p>“But how’s he going to set about it?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“That is still a little vague. I think there is to be a sort
of Proclamation. He’s thinking that out upstairs now. He
seems to think that he has to call up some sort of disciples.
Then I think he will go down to Westminster and take
the Speaker’s place on the Woolsack or something of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
sort. It <i>is</i> the Speaker sits on the Woolsack, isn’t it? Or is
it the Lord Chancellor? Anyhow, there are to be demonstrations—on
a large and dignified scale. The people have
forgotten the ancient simple laws, he says. He himself
had forgotten them. But he has remembered them now;
they have come back to him, and presently every one will
remember them, all the great old things, justice, faith,
obedience, mutual service. As it was in Ancient Sumeria.
Dreamland Ancient Sumeria, you know. The dear old
Golden Age. He has come to remind people of the true
things in life—which every one has forgotten. And when
he has reminded them every one will remember. And be
good. And there you are, Tessy! I hope it will affect
Susan—but I don’t feel at all sure. I have a sort of
feeling that Susan could stash up any golden age they
started in about five minutes, but then perhaps I’m a bit
prejudiced about her.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather wonderful all the same,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> rather wonderful. He sits up there and looks at
you with his little round innocent face and tells you all
these things. And, assuming he’s Lord of the World,
they’re perfectly right and proper. He sits with the map of
the world unrolled on the table. I ventured to suggest that
he would require a lot of subordinate rulers and directors.
‘They will come,’ he said. ‘No office, no duty shall be
done henceforth except by the Proper People. That has
been neglected too long. Let every man do that he is
best fitted to do. Then everything will be well.’”</p>

<p>“And when’s all this to begin?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Any time. I don’t think—” Bobby’s expression became
profoundly judicial. “I don’t think he’ll do anything
for a day or so. I pointed out to him that he ought to
consider his demonstrations very carefully before he makes
them, and he seemed inclined to agree. Some mistake, he
says, has occurred already—I couldn’t find out what.
Apparently to-morrow he is just going to look at London,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
quietly but firmly, from the Monument and from the
Dome of Saint Paul’s. And also he wants to observe the
manners of his subjects in the streets and railway stations,
and wherever there is a concourse of people. The scales
have fallen from his eyes, he explains, and now that he
knows that he is Lord of the World he realizes how distressed
and unsatisfactory everybody’s life is—even when
they don’t know it’s unsatisfactory. His own life was
terribly unsatisfactory he says, unreal and frustrated,
until he awoke and realized the greatness of his destiny.”</p>

<p>“And what was that life of his?” asked Tessy.</p>

<p>“I tried to get that. And he caught the eager note in
my voice I suppose, and shut up like an oyster. The
draper’s shop perhaps. Or a milk-round. I wonder.”</p>

<p>“But, Bobby,” cried Billy in the expostulatory tone of one
who remonstrates with wild unreason; “he must come from
<i>somewhere</i>!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Bobby. “And somewhere must be looking
for him. But you can’t always hurry these things.
And meanwhile I take it it’s our bounden duty to keep
an eye on him and see that he doesn’t bump himself too
hard or fall into the wrong hands.... Until some one
comes along.... Don’t you get up, Tessy, you’re tired.”</p>

<p>And Bobby jumped to his feet and proceeded to change
the plates and dishes while Billy fell into a profound
meditation upon the problem of the new neighbour
upstairs.</p>

<p>Presently he smiled and shook his head in kindly
disapproval.</p>

<p>“This will suit Bobby all right,” he said to Tessy.
“Whenever he ought to be upstairs in his own room getting
on with that novel of his he will be up on the second floor
talking to—what is it?—Sargon.”</p>

<p>“Accumulating material,” corrected Bobby from the
Welsh dresser where he was turning a tin of peaches out
into a glass dish. “Accumulating evidence.... Not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
a spider could spin a yarn out of an empty stomach.
Tessy, have you just simply <i>lost</i> the cream or have you
put it away in a new place very carefully for me to guess?
Oh, right-o! I’ve got it.”</p>

<h4>§ 8</h4>

<p>Let us be frank about it; Sargon had his doubts.</p>

<p>Not always. There were times when his fantasy was
bravely alive and carried him high above any shadow of
uncertainty, and he was all that he could have ever wished
to be. Then Mr. Preemby was almost forgotten. But
there were moments, there were phases, when he became
aware of a cold undertow of conviction that he was after
all just Mr. Preemby, Mr. Preemby, formerly of the
Limpid Stream Laundry, making believe, carrying it off
and perhaps presently failing to carry it off. This chill
flow of doubt could even oblige him to reason with himself,
force him into a definite reassurance of himself. He
would debate the whole question, candidly, fairly. Surely
there was no deception, could have been no deception,
about that séance. “Told me things no one but I could
have known,” he would repeat. “I pin my faith to that.”</p>

<p>He knew that Christina Alberta had not really believed.
It was just because of her revealing scepticism that he had
fled from her. She had asked questions, tearing, rending
questions, and she had said “Um.” It is not proper to say
“Um” to world emperors. If presently he fasted or went
into a trance, he felt sure that she would come and stand
about beside him and say “Um,” and spoil everything.
Well, anyhow, he was away from that for a bit. But to be
away from doubt was not enough. The great discovery
threatened to evaporate. He wanted the comfort of the
disciple. He wanted help and reassurance.</p>

<p>Bobby had comforted him greatly. While Sargon had
been going from one suspicious lodging-house keeper to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
another, the faith of the new Saviour of mankind had
weakened dreadfully. But Bobby from the first had had
something deferential in his manner, had seemed to understand.
His questions had grown more and more intelligent.
Perhaps he was to be the first of the reawakened adherents.
Perhaps presently he would be recognizable as some faithful
servant in that still so largely forgotten past, a trusted
general perhaps or some intimate court official.</p>

<p>Yet even when Sargon doubted he believed. It is a very
comprehensible paradox. He knew clearly that to be
Sargon was to be real, was to signify and make all the
world signify, was to go back into the past and reach right
out into the future, was to escape altogether from the
shrivelled insignificance of the Preemby life. To be
Sargon was to achieve not only greatness but goodness.
Sargon could give and Sargon could dare. Sargon could
face lions and die for his people, but Preemby could go
round three fields, had been known to go round three fields,
to evade the hostility of a barking terrier. Preemby’s world
was dust and dirt, a mud speck in infinite space, and there
was no life on it but abjection. Preemby was death;
Sargon was rebirth into a world of spacious things. Not
very clearly did Sargon achieve these realizations, but
he felt them throughout his being. Something had happened
to him of inestimable value and truth; he had to
cling to this gift and hold it and keep it or be for ever
fallen. Christina Alberta notwithstanding, the whole world
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>So he walked up and down his little upper room in Midgard
Street and elaborated his conception of his new rôle
as lord and protector of the whole world. Twilight gave
place to night but he did not turn on the light. He liked
the friendly darkness. All visible things are limiting things,
but the darkness goes out and beyond everything to God.
“I must look,” he said. “I must watch and observe. But
not for too long. There is action. Action gives life. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
fellow Preemby, poor soul, he could look at things, but
dared he lift a finger? No! Everywhere suffering, everywhere
injustice and disorder, the desert and the wilderness
breaking back in on us and he did nothing. If one does
not call and call aloud, how can one expect an answer?
In this world, vast, terrible—strikes—hoardings—adulteration—profiteers....
Nevertheless men who once lived
bravely and did their duty.... Who may do it again....
Once they hear the call. Awake! Remember!
The High Path. Simple Honour. Sargon calls you....
H’rrmp....”</p>

<p>He came to a halt at his uncurtained window and looked
out on the plain, flat face of the opposite houses, pierced
here and there by a lit window. Most had the blinds
drawn, but just opposite a woman worked by lamp-light
at a table, sewing something, her needle hand flew out
perpetually and the book and one hand and the cuff of a
reader came also into the picture, the rest of him hidden
behind the curtain. At a bedroom window there was a
looking-glass, and a girl tried on a hat and looked at it this
way and that; then suddenly she vanished, and after a
little interval the light went out.</p>

<p>“All their scattered lives,” said Sargon, holding out his
arms with a benevolent gesture, “knitted—drawn together
by wisdom and love. A rudder put on the drifting world.”</p>

<p>Came a knock at the door. “Come in,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>Bobby appeared. “Getting on all right, sir?” he said in
his engaging subaltern manner. He clicked on the electric
light and came into the room. (Cadaverous and pleasant
face he had; surely one would remember presently what
he had been.) “Wondered if you were eating anything
to-night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I quite forgot eating,” said Sargon. “Quite. My mind—troubled
by many grave matters. I have much to think
of, much to plan. The hour grows late. The time is near.
I wonder if the serving woman here——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Only breakfasts,” said Bobby. “Here we are on bed
and breakfast terms strictly. The rest is with ourselves.
For an emergency like this there is nothing so good as the
Rubicon Restaurant. The Grill Room keeps open quite
late. They will do you a chop or a cutlet. Or ham and
eggs. Very good ham and eggs—crisp ham. You go out
from here, turn to the left at the second corner, and go
right down Hampshire Street until you come to it. You’ll
have no difficulty in finding it.”</p>

<p>The word “crisp” had settled it.</p>

<p>“I will avail myself,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“And it’s equally easy to find your way back,” said
Bobby with a faint flavour of anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>“Have no fear, young man,” said Sargon in a tone of
jolly reassurance. “Have no fear. I’ve found my way in
many climes and under many conditions—the wild
mountains—the trackless desert. Time and space.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Bobby. “I forgot that.</p>

<p>“Still—London is different,” said Bobby.</p>

<h4>§ 9</h4>

<p>The next day at about half-past four in the afternoon a
small but heavily moustached figure, with eyes full of blue
determination, emerged from Saint Paul’s Cathedral and
stood at the top of the steps before the great doors, surveying
the jostling traffic of Ludgate Hill and the Churchyard.
There was a sort of valiant uncertainty in the figure’s pose,
as though it was equally resolved to be up to something,
and uncertain about what it meant to do. London had
been looked at from the top of the Monument and from
the Cathedral dome on a crystal-clear October day, and it
had betrayed an unusual loveliness and greatness under
the golden sunshine. But it had shown itself, too, as a vast
dreamy multitudinousness in which none but those who
are resolute and powerful in action can hope to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
being swallowed up. It had stretched away to wide sunlit
stretches that seemed to be the horizon, and then up in
the leaden-blue other stretches had been visible of houses,
of shipping, of distant hills. The vans and carts in the
shadowed streets below had looked like toys; the people
were hats and hurrying legs and feet, curiously proportioned.
And over all an immense dome of kindly cloud-flecked
sky.</p>

<p>He had walked round the little gallery under the ball,
muttering: “A wilderness. A city that has forgotten....</p>

<p>“How fair it might be. How great it might be!</p>

<p>“How fair and great it <i>shall</i> be!”</p>

<p>And now he had come down again from these high places
and the time had come for him to gather together his
disciples and ministers and inaugurate the New World.
He had to call them. Followers would not come to him
unless he called them; they would wait for him to act, not
know even of what awaited them until he called them, but
when he called them they would surely come.</p>

<p>It was with an extraordinary sense of power over men’s
destinies that he stood now upon Saint Paul’s steps and
reflected that even now men and women might be passing
by, among these busy men thronging the pavement, among
the people in omnibuses, among the girls clattering away
at their typewriters behind the upstairs windows, over
whose busy, petty, undistinguished lives hung the challenge
of his summons. Yonder perhaps was his Abu Bekr, his
right-hand man, his Peter. Let them wait a little longer.
He waved the traffic onward with a gesture of kindly
encouragement. “Soon now,” he said, “very soon. Go on
while ye may. Even now the sorting of the lots begins.”</p>

<p>Yet a moment more he stood still and silent, a statuette
of destiny. “And now,” he whispered; “and now....</p>

<p>“And first——”</p>

<p>He was no longer troubled by his oblivion of the
Sumerian tongue. In the night he had recovered the gift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
of tongues; he had muttered strange words in the darkness,
and understood.</p>

<p>“H’rrmp,” he said, a word common to many tongues,
clearing the way after five thousand years for the return of
the forgotten sounds to a renewed use in the world of men.
“Dadendo Fizzoggo Grandioso Magnificendodidodo—yes,”
he whispered. “The Unveiling of the Countenance.
The First Revelation. Then perhaps they will see.”</p>

<p>And slowly he descended the steps, his eyes searching the
convergent frontages of the Churchyard for some intimations
of a barber’s shop.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE SECOND<br>

<i>The Calling of the Disciples</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<small>HERE</small> are already wide differences of statement and
opinion about the order and the details of the calling
of the followers of Sargon. Happily we are in a position to
give the circumstances with all the exactitude that may be
necessary, and with an authority that will anticipate vexatious
criticism. It was about half-past six that Sargon
appeared in Cheapside, and the day’s traffic was already
ebbing in that busy city thoroughfare. His countenance
was transformed and shone with that kind of luminosity
that only the most thorough and exhaustive shaving can
give. A youthful smoothness had been restored to it. The
facial mane, the vast moustache, that had veiled it for so
many years from mankind was abandoned, a mess of clippings
and lather now in a barber’s basin. Now the face
was as bare as the young Alexander, a fresh-complexioned,
sincere and innocent countenance speaking clearly with an
unfiltered voice. It was flushed with a natural excitement
as it went along Cheapside scrutinizing the faces of the
foot passengers on a momentous and mystical search.
The blue eyes beneath the brim of the distinguished-looking
hat were alight. Was it to be this man? Was it to be this?</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>The first to be called was a young man of Leytonstone
named Godley, a young man with a large and excessively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
grave grey face and a deliberation of utterance amounting
to an impediment. He was carrying a microscope in a
wooden box. He was a student of biology with a cytological
bias; naturally very polite and temperamentally
disposed to be precise and deliberate in all he said and did.
He was making his way from Liverpool Street station to
the Birkbeck Institute by a circuitous route because he had
nearly an hour in hand before his class began. He stood
poised on the pavement edge at a street-corner waiting for
two vans to pass, when his call came to him.</p>

<p>He found a very earnest, barefaced little man beside him
whose blue eyes searched his countenance swiftly, and who
then gripped his arm.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Sargon, “that it is you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Godley, who was not without a sense of humour,
attempted to reply that it certainly was him, but that
impediment of his, partly natural but greatly developed by
affectation, arrested him about the word “certainly,” and
he was still sawing the air with his profile when Sargon
spoke again.</p>

<p>“I have need of your help,” said Sargon. “The great
task is beginning.”</p>

<p>Mr. Godley went through the preliminary convulsions of
explaining that he had the better part of an hour to spare
and that he was willing to give help in any reasonable
matter provided it was first explained to him clearly just
exactly what the matter was. But he could only give help
for a limited time. His engagement with his class at the
Birkbeck was imperative. Sargon paid little heed to the
significance of the various sounds that Mr. Godley was
biting off and swallowing. He led his captive by the arm
and explained, with helpful gestures of his free hand, the
full significance of this call. “You are, I perceive, a young
man of scientific qualifications. They will be needed. I do
not know if you recognize me—your memory may still be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
imperfect—but I recall your face, chief among the wise
men of our ancient court. Yes, indeed, chief among our
wise men.”</p>

<p>“N-no-no-not as-as-assure that I follow you aw-ow-ow
quite,” said the young man. “My my—my aw-ow-ow-work
issferr’ll aw-ow-ow-known as yet.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> know it,” said Sargon boldly. “<i>I</i> know it. I have been
seeking you. Do not be deceived by my plain incognito.
Believe me I have tremendous powers behind me. In a
little while all men will understand. The age of confusion
draws near its end; a new age begins. We are the first two
particles, the very first, in a great crystallization——”</p>

<p>“Where aaare we g-g-g-oing agg-aggs-aggs-exactly?”
asked the young man.</p>

<p>“Trust me,” said Sargon bravely. “Keep with me.”</p>

<p>The young man struggled with some complex question.
But now three fresh individuals came under the magic
attraction of the call and the young man’s question fell in
unheeded chunks. These new adherents were a little
group of men standing at the kerb, about a small, almost
inaudible hurdy-gurdy on which was a placard stating:
“We want Work not Charity; but there is no Work for Us
in this So-called Civilized State.” They were clad in faded
khaki, and were all youths of less than five-and-twenty.</p>

<p>“Now look at that!” said Sargon. “Is it not time the new
age began?”</p>

<p>He addressed himself to the man on the right of the
organ-grinder.</p>

<p>“All this is to be altered here and now,” he said. “I have
work for you to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the ex-soldier in the accent of a fairly well-educated
man. “What sort of work?”</p>

<p>“We’re straight,” said the organ-grinder. “We’ll take it.
If it’s work we can do. We ain’t fakers. Wot work is it?”</p>

<p>“Shillin’ an hour?” said the third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“More than that. Much more than that. And very great
and responsible work. A harvest! A splendid harvest!
You shall be leaders of men. Follow after me.”</p>

<p>“Far?” asked the man who had spoken first.</p>

<p>Sargon made a gesture that effectually concealed his own
lack of a definite plan, and led the way.</p>

<p>“Lead on, Macbeth,” said the organ-grinder, and swung
his hurdy-gurdy into its carrying position on his back.
The two other ex-soldiers exchanged views that it was
all right and that anyhow they’d see what was offered
them. Mr. Godley, keeping abreast of his leader, began
an immense and ultimately futile struggle with a fresh
question.</p>

<p>The next disciple was not so much called as fell into the
gathering body of Sargonites. He was a tall gentleman of
a rich brown colour with frizzy black hair, and a vast disarming
smile. He was dressed in an almost luminous grey
frock-suit, a pink tie, buttoned shoes with bright yellow
uppers, and a hat as distinguished as Sargon’s own. He
carried a grey alpaca umbrella. He held out a sheet of
paper in a big mahogany hand and emitted in a rich abundant
voice the word “Escuse.” The paper had printed on it
at the head the words, “Lean and Mackay, 329 Leadenhall
Street, E.C.” and below written in ink, “Mr. Kama
Mobamba.”</p>

<p>Sargon regarded his interlocutor for a moment and then
recognized him. “The Elamite King!” he said.</p>

<p>“Non spik English,” said the black gentleman. “Portugaish.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sargon with a gesture that explained his intention.
“Providence. Follow after me.”</p>

<p>The coloured gentleman fell in trustfully.</p>

<p>“Look here!” protested one of the ex-soldiers. “There
ain’t going to be coloured labor on this job?”</p>

<p>“Peace!” said Sargon. “Very soon everything will be
shown to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“I don’t think you have any ub-ub-business to mislead
ap-ap-people,” said Mr. Godley, who was becoming more
and more interested in, and perplexed by, Sargon’s proceedings.</p>

<p>Sargon quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“This—this gentleman s-s-s-simply wa-wa-wanted tu-tu-tu-tu-to
go to that address,” said Mr. Godley.</p>

<p>In his eagerness to get the idea home to Sargon he
became a little disregardful of his microscope box which
inflicted a sudden sharp blow on the knee of a passing
gentleman, a business man in a silk hat. The victim cursed
aloud with extraordinary vehemence and stood hopping on
the pavement with his hand to his knee. Then he succumbed
to a passionate impulse to tell Mr. Godley exactly
what he thought of his conduct, his upbringing, and his
type of human being. He joined the followers of Sargon
at a brisk limp, occasionally saying “Hi!” in a breathless
voice. A rather intoxicated man in deep mourning had
witnessed the incident. He came hurrying, with a certain
margin of error, to the side of the angry gentleman in the
silk hat.</p>

<p>“’Sgraceful salt,” he said. “’Sgraceful! F’want a witness
<i>I</i>’m your man!”</p>

<p>His general intention was to go forward at the side of the
gentleman in the silk hat, but there were chemically emancipated
factors in his being that drove him sideways.
The resultant was a sinuous course that presently involved
him with a display of oranges in a barrow at the pavement
edge. It was not a serious nor a prolonged contact, but it
involved a certain scattering of oranges in the gutter and
added a new ingredient, a very angry costermonger’s
assistant with a remonstrance and a claim for damages, to
the gathering body of Sargon’s followers.</p>

<p>The moral of a proverb depends entirely upon the image
chosen, and though a rolling stone gathers no moss, a rolling
snowball grows by what it rolls upon. A small hurrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
group of people in a London street is a moving body
of the snowball type; its physical pull is considerable; it
appeals to curiosity and the increasing gregariousness of
mankind. Sargon, blue-eyed and exalted, with Mr. Godley
intent and eloquent upon his left hand, and Mr. Kama
Mobamba, tall, silent, smiling, with a shining confidence
upon his ebony face that soon he would be led into the
presence of Messrs. Lean and Mackay, formed the spearhead
of the procession. Behind came the three out-of-work
ex-soldiers, who were now involved in obscure protests
and explanations with the gentleman in the silk hat, and
a smart but rather incomprehensible young newspaper
reporter, who had acquired his native tongue in Oldham,
and had just come up to London to push his fortunes, and
was anxious for something called a “scoop.” He seemed
to think that Sargon might be the “scoop” he sought. Two
ambiguous-looking individuals in caps and neck-wraps
had also fallen in, possibly for nefarious purposes, a vague-faced
young woman of the streets in a weather-worn
magenta hat was asking what was “<i>up</i>” and the intoxicated
man in mourning was explaining as wittily and obscurely
as possible. There was also a fringe of skirmishing juveniles.
And an Eton boy. He was very, very young and
fresh-faced, a scion of one of the oldest and best families
in England and a convinced and fierce Communist. He
had been on his way with a bosom friend to the celebrated
model engine shop in Holborn when Sargon had swept
past him and the inscription on the organ had caught
his eye.</p>

<p>He was a boy of swift initiatives and with a highly developed
dramatic sense.</p>

<p>“Sorry, old Fellow,” he said to his friend. “But I feel
the time has come. Unless I’m very much mistaken that
little bunch is the beginning of the Social Revolution, and I
must do my duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Oo I <i>say</i>, Rabbit!” said the friend. “Come and buy
that steam-launch first, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“<i>What’s</i> a model steam-launch?” said Rabbit scornfully,
and turned to follow Sargon.</p>

<p>He would have liked to have had a swift strong hand-clasp
first, but you can’t do that sort of thing with a chap
who will always keep both hands in his trouser pockets.
He darted off, and his friend followed discreetly in a state
between amusement and dismay, and at such a distance as
seemed to him to exonerate him from any personal complicity
with the social revolution.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” asked the young Etonian as he
came up with the hindmost of the out-of-work ex-soldiers.</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> knows,” said the out-of-work ex-soldier, indicating
Sargon.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>But that was exactly what our dear Sargon did not know.
By this time he was no longer a convinced and complete
Sargon. A scared and doubting and protesting Preemby
was struggling back into his being.</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of the calling of the disciples Sargon
had ruled in his own soul assured and unchallenged. But
he had expected his disciples to respond to his call, to
recognize and remember, to be immediately understanding
and helpful. The calling was to have been like the
lighting of a lamp in their minds and the world about
them. He had expected not only his own clear and unquestioning
conviction but accession and reinforcement for
it. And so leaping from soul to soul the restoration of
Humanity, the Empire of Sargon would have spread. For
disciples who made conditions, for disciples who followed,
gesticulating strangely and spluttering and bubbling and
stammering injurious criticisms, for disciples who asked
for a minimum wage, and for disciples who came limping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
after one calling “Hi!” as though one was a cab, Sargon
was totally unprepared.</p>

<p>Had he called these disciples rashly? Had he been premature
again? Had he made another mistake?</p>

<p>These were unpleasantly urgent questions for a Master
to solve while he was going briskly to nowhere in particular
about four miles an hour along Holborn with his following
gathering at his heels. Perhaps all leadership is a kind of
flight. In every leader of men perhaps the fugitive has
been latent. In Sargon now it was more than latent; it was
awake and stirring, and its name was Preemby.</p>

<p>Since first mankind in its slow ascent from mere animalism
became susceptible to Prophets and Great Teachers
and Leaders there must always have been something of
this internal conflict between the greatness of the mission
and something discreetly less, and there must also have
been always something of this clash of the disciples’
quality and motive with the teacher’s expectations. The
very calling of disciples seems to admit a sense of weakness
on the prophet’s part. Their calling puts him in pledge.
He puts himself in pledge to them. They will, he knows,
hold him to it when he falters; deep gregarious instincts
assure him he will not desert his declaration to them even
when he might desert himself. They desert him—inevitably.
In the whole record of the world there is only one
unvarying, faithful disciple, Abu Bekr. All other disciples
failed and crippled their Masters and misled them. They
deserted or they drove the prophet whither he would not
go. Great things and little things of the same kind follow
the same laws. At the head of that small wedge of commotion
driving along lamp-lit Holborn in the October
twilight went Sargon the Lord and Protector of Mankind,
the Restorer of Faith and Justice, the Magnificent One,
and though he was already aware of an error made and
dangers incurred, he was still resolved to pull a great
occasion by some stupendous gesture out of the jaws of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
disaster. And closer than his shadow was Preemby, scared
nearly out of his wits, ready for a desperate headlong bolt
down any side turning, a bolt from explanation, a bolt
from effort, a bolt back to Preembyism and infinite
nothingness.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came to Sargon a reassuring voice, the
voice of one who had at least seemed to believe and accept.</p>

<p>There had been a slight altercation with Billy before
Bobby came hurrying across the road. “There he goes!”
said Bobby.</p>

<p>“That isn’t him,” said Billy. “Where’s his moustache?
He was pretty nearly all moustache.”</p>

<p>“Shaved,” said Bobby. “I’d swear to him anywhere. A
sort of prance in his walk. It’s our prophet, Billy, and he’s
heading for trouble.”</p>

<p>“Looks more like a welsher,” said Billy. “Where’d he
get that ecstatic nigger? It’s too rummy for me altogether,
Bobby. You keep out of it. There’s a policeman tacking
on now.”</p>

<p>Bobby hesitated. “Can’t let him go like that,” he said,
and dodged across the road just as four racing omnibuses
blotted out the Sargonites from Billy’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, but where are you going?” said Bobby,
stooping to Sargon’s grateful ear in spite of a considerable
push from Mr. Godley.</p>

<p>“I have declared myself,” said Sargon, and straightway
reassurance came. This was the First of the Disciples,
and he had found his way to his Master. Quite clearly
now did Sargon see what he had to do. These first followers
had to be instructed. The Teaching had to begin.
To do that it was necessary to lead them apart out of the
hurry and tumult of the street. A vision came to Sargon
of a long brightly lit table, and an array of disciples
asking questions, and of memorable answers and great
sayings. And straight ahead, glowing, bursting with light,
already a friend, there towered up the inviting mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
the Rubicon Restaurant, pioneer in the great enterprise
of supplying dinners de luxe at popular prices.</p>

<p>“Yonder,” said Sargon with a sweeping gesture of the
hand, “we will rest and sit at meat, and I will talk, and all
things shall be explained.”</p>

<p>The bright vision of a discourse to a gathering of disciples
at a table had so restored the gloriousness of Sargon
that by the time he reached the entrance of the Rubicon
Restaurant, which bulges invitingly at a corner, he had
called two further disciples. One of these acquisitions was
a matchbox-holding beggar of venerable appearance, and
the other a highly intelligent-looking man of perhaps fifty,
lean and thinly bearded, carrying a book on the Doukhobors
and wearing mittens and a tall black felt hat—a
hat of an unusual shape rather like the steam-dome of a
railway engine. This last acquisition was made at the very
door of the Restaurant.</p>

<p>“Come in here,” said Sargon, seizing his arm, “and take
meat with me. I have things to tell you that will change
your whole life.”</p>

<p>“This is very <i>suddan</i>,” said the intelligent-looking man,
speaking in the high neighing protesting accent of an
English scholar and gentleman, as he yielded himself to
Sargon’s grip.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>The actual invasion of the Rubicon Restaurant was a
confused and swift affair. Sargon’s mind was clear and
simple now; he had to make that vision of a long white
table with his disciples grouped about him a reality or
incur a great defeat. His following was animated by a
mixture of unequal and incompatible motives, as all followings
are, and it was now swollen to something near
thirty—the exact number is uncertain because it passed
marginally into mere onlookers and passers-by—by the
action of the least worthy of the three out-of-work ex-soldiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
who had been uttering these magic words, “A
Free Feed!” ever since the Rubicon Restaurant had been
in sight.</p>

<p>The attention of that challenging individual, the outside
porter, had happened to be distracted by the arrival of
guests in a motor car when the Sargonites came along.
They therefore swept through the outer entrance without
encountering any obstacle other than the rotating door,
which chopped the little crowd into ones and twos before
it reached the entrance hall. Perhaps twenty got into the
entrance hall, that space of marble and mahogany and
hovering cloak-room attendants, before the mechanical incompetence
of the man in deep mourning and his subsequent
extraction by the politely indignant outer porter, the costermonger’s
assistant intervening unhelpfully, jammed the
apparatus. The man with the bruised shin seems to
have fallen out before the restaurant was reached, and
the vague-faced young woman in the magenta had drifted
away at some unnoted moment.</p>

<p>In the spacious, glittering and observant outer hall a
tendency to dispersal manifested itself. The out-of-work
ex-soldier with the organ, seized by a sudden shyness, made
for the gentleman’s cloak-room to deposit his instrument
and became involved in an argument with his colleagues.
The two ambiguous young men in caps and neck-wraps
seem to have hesitated about the correctness of their costume.
But Sargon held the newly caught gentleman tight,
and the venerable match-seller did not mean to be separated
from his patron in this bright, luxurious, dangerous place.
Mr. Kama Mobamba, tall and smiling and shining, handed
hat and umbrella to an attendant and followed closely
upon the Master, serene in his assurance that these were
the lordly portals of the long sought firm of African traders,
Lean and Mackay. And Mr. Godley, with his natural
passion for explicitness, would not leave Sargon until he
had made it perfectly clear to him why he did not feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
bound to accompany him further. He came next after the
others into the Large Restaurant, making noises like a
cuckoo clock that has lost control of itself. The reporter
from Oldham was also holding on, though in considerable
doubt now what sort of story he would have to write. The
Eton boy, more than half aware now of his error, and so
disposed to be a little detached also, came into the restaurant
after depositing hat and umbrella without.</p>

<p>Bobby never came through. He was overtaken and held
up in the entrance hall by Billy. “This isn’t your affair,
Bobby,” said Billy. “This really isn’t your affair.”</p>

<p>“I can’t make out what he’s up to,” said Bobby. “He’s
bound to get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Never mind.”</p>

<p>“But I do mind.”</p>

<p>“The management’s scared,” said Billy. “They’re sending
for the police. There’s a crowd gathered outside. Look
at the faces looking in. See that chap peering through the
hole in the glass? Nice thing for Tessy and Susan if we
get into some police-court scrape.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t leave him to get into a mess here.”</p>

<p>“But how can we help him?”</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Within the restaurant Sargon made his supreme and
final effort and encountered swift and overwhelming
defeat. But at any rate he did not run away. He made a
frontal attack on the world he had set out to subdue—as
Sargon. As Sargon, invincibly Sargon, he met disaster.</p>

<p>Things had not begun to be very brisk yet in the Rubicon
Restaurant. But indeed it is never so brisk in the Rubicon
of an evening as it is at lunch time; it is too far from the
west; pre-eminently a luncheon place. And the hour even
for such briskness as is customary had not yet come. The
neat lines of the little white tables, each with its lamp and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
flowers, were only broken here and there by occupants. A
family group going to a circus; a little knot of people going
to a meeting in the Kingsway Hall; three or four couples
of theatre-goers in evening dress; three or four of those
odd couples of a rather inexperienced looking middle-aged
business man and an extremely inexperienced looking
young woman in imperfectly conceived dinner dress who
are to be seen everywhere in London, and a group of three
business men from the north dressed in a canny grey and
dining with a resolute completeness from cocktail to
liqueur, was all the company yet assembled in the body of
the restaurant. There were one or two occupants in the
lower gallery, dimly seen; the upper gallery was unlit. The
atmosphere was still timorous and chilly; even the three
men from the north exacted their tale of London luxury
in a subdued and even furtive manner.</p>

<p>The staff was still largely unemployed. The head-waiters,
wine-waiters and table-waiters fidgeted serviettes and
glasses, or stood about with that expression of self-astonishment
and melancholy upon their faces habitual to
waiters. A slight hubbub in the entrance hall and the
sound of the smashing of the glass in the rotating door by
the last effort of the man in mourning preceded the entry
of Sargon.</p>

<p>Every one looked up. The guests forgot their food and
their company manners; the waiters forgot their secret
sorrows. Sargon appeared, an inconspicuous figure, a little
white, almost luminous face, round bright eyes. With one
hand he still gripped his last disciple. With the other he
waved aside the gobbets of speech which Mr. Godley
proffered him. A tall expectant negro face rose like a
shield of ebony and ivory above him. Behind were the
match-seller and other followers, less clearly apprehended.</p>

<p>A head-waiter faced him. Behind hovered a manager
and a little further off an assistant manager fiddled with
the fruit on the buffet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>Sargon released his latest catch and stood forward.</p>

<p>“Set a table here,” he said with a fine gesture. “Set a
table here for a great company. I have called a following
and must needs discourse with them.”</p>

<p>“Table, sir,” said the head-waiter. “For ’ow many, sir?”</p>

<p>“A great company.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the head-waiter with an appealing
glance at the manager, “we’d like to ’ave an idea ’ow
many.”</p>

<p>The manager came up to take control and the assistant
manager deserted his piles of fruit and came up behind
helpfully. Sargon perceived he was against opposition and
gathered all the forces within him. “It is a great company,”
he said. “It must sit at meat with me here and I must discourse
to it. These people yonder may join. Set all the
tables one to another. The day of separate tables and
separate lives is at an end. Let even the tables manifest
the Brotherhood of Man. Under Our Rule. Set them
together.”</p>

<p>At the words “Brotherhood of Man” one of the three
business men from the north was smitten with understanding.
“It’s a blood-stained Bolshevik,” he said, or words to
that effect. “Shovin’ in here! Of all places!”</p>

<p>“Oughtn’t to be allowed,” said his friend. “Aren’t we to
have <i>no</i> peace from them?”</p>

<p>The first business man expressed a general antipathy for
incarmined Bolsheviks and went on eating bread in a
hurried, fussed, irritated manner. “When’s that Fricassee
of Chicken coming?” he said. “They must have dropped it
or something.”</p>

<p>But the manager’s intelligence had been even quicker
than the business man’s. A swift signal had been given at
the very beginning of Sargon’s speech. The waiter sent to
summon the police had already sped past Billy and Bobby
and the rest of the uncertain crowd in the entrance
hall, draughty now and uneasy because of the broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
glass in the rotating door that the man in mourning had
broken.</p>

<p>But Sargon heeded nothing of this byplay. He held on
to the only course that he could see before him, which was
to overwhelm the opposition that gathered against him.</p>

<p>“We don’t have banquets in this room, sir,” said the
manager, playing for time. “Banquets you can have in the
Syrian Hall or in the Elysian Chamber or in the Great
Masonic or Little Masonic Hall—given due notice and
after proper arrangements, but this is the general public
restaurant. You can’t <i>suddenly</i> give a banquet to an unknown
company or society or something here. We don’t
cater for that. It isn’t done.”</p>

<p>“It will be done to-night,” said Sargon, with a glance and
intonation and gesture that would have bent all dream
Sumeria to its knees.</p>

<p>But the managers of European restaurants are made of
sterner stuff, it seems, than were the old Sumerians. “I’m
afraid <i>not</i>, sir,” he said, and stood blandly obstructive.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” cried Sargon, “who it is with whom you
have to deal?”</p>

<p>“Not one of our regular customers, sir,” said the manager,
with the apologetic air of one who scores a point perforce.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Sargon. “This day is an Epoch. This is
the End and the Beginning of an Age. Men will count
this banquet I shall hold here the sunrise moment of a
new world. I am Sargon, Sargon the Great, Sargon the
Restorer, come to proclaim myself. This multitude of
my followers must be fed and instructed here, fed bodily
and fed spiritually. See to it that your share is done.”</p>

<p>He made a gesture behind him when he spoke of his
followers, but indeed there was no following behind him
now save that one faithful but deluded African, and that
perplexed but persistent Oldham reporter. The Eton boy
had detached himself completely now. He was sitting at a
table afar off, where he had been joined by his friend, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
they conversed in undertones and watched. Even Mr.
Godley with his microscope, and the gentleman with the
book about the Doukhobors, had faded out of this story by
this time, and were going along Holborn exchanging and
interrupting each other’s explanations and surmises about
this singular affair that had so unexpectedly deflected their
high and reasonable progress through life.</p>

<p>“I can only sus-sas-sas-suppose that-the-fellow-was-mad,”
said Mr. Godley.</p>

<p>While Sargon’s retinue had melted the manager’s had
gathered. Behind him now stood an array of waiters of
every description, three dozen perhaps of various and yet
uniform waiters, tall waiters and short ones, fat and thin,
hairy and bald, young and old, waiters in aprons and one
in shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re creating a disturbance here,” said the
manager. “I’m afraid I must ask you to go, sir.”</p>

<p>Should he go? Never!</p>

<p>“Oh, generation of blind and deaf!” he cried, lifting his
voice in an attempt to reach the scattered diners beyond
this lowering crowd of waiting men, “do you not recognize
me? Have you neither memories nor vision? Do you not
see the light that offers itself to you? Can you not hear
the call that thrills throughout the world? The hour for
awakening has come. It is to-day; it is now. You may
cease to be things of habit and servitude, and you may
become masters of a world reborn. Now! This moment.
<i>Will</i> the change with me and the change is upon you!
Sargon calls you, Sargon the Ancient and the Eternal, the
Wise Ruler and the Bold One, calls you to light, to nobility,
to freedom——”</p>

<p>“’Fraid we can’t let you make speeches here,” said the
manager with hand extended.</p>

<p>“Let’s chuck ’im out <i>now</i>,” said a short, thick-set waiter.</p>

<p>“Chuck him out!” said the anti-Bolshevik business man,
standing up and speaking in a voice replete with indignation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and gathering volume as he went on. “And then bring
us our Fricassee of Chicken. We have been waiting Ten
Minutes for <span class="allsmcap">THAT FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN</span>!”</p>

<p>And then a voice could be heard saying: “Wot’s it all
<i>about</i>?” and suddenly a policeman stood beside Sargon and
overshadowed him.</p>

<p>A wave of horror went through his soul, a wave of horror
that was entirely Preemby. Throughout his whole virtuous
life he had never once been in antagonism to the Police.
“Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!” cried this horror in his soul. “What
have I done now? I’m going to be run in!” The blue eyes
grew rounder and he gasped for air, but no one there
perceived how close he came to ignominious collapse.
Preemby shivered and passed. Sargon choked and then
spoke stoutly. “What is this, Officer?” he said. “Would
you lay hands on the Master of the World?”</p>

<p>“My duty, sir, if he makes a disturbance,” said the policeman.
“Master or no Master.”</p>

<p>Very rapidly did Sargon adjust himself to this new phase
in his affairs. He was defeated. He was to be led away.
Yes, but he was still Sargon. The Power that ruled him
had thrust him into defeat, but that could only be to try
him. He had not expected this of the Power, but since the
Power willed it, so it had to be.</p>

<p>“You understand, Officer, what it is you are doing?” he
said, magnificently and gently.</p>

<p>“Quite, sir. I ’ope you don’t intend to give us any
trouble.”</p>

<p>A captive! Not thus had he foreseen the revelation of the
Master. He gave one last look at the rich decorations of
the great restaurant in which the opening banquet was to
have taken place. Not here then but in some squalid
police-court it was that the New Empire of Justice and
Brotherhood had to be proclaimed.</p>

<p>He turned in silence and went out at the policeman’s side
quietly, deep in thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>So ended Sargon’s first effort to enter into his Empire.
Unless we count the visit to Buckingham Palace as his first
attempt.</p>

<p>But before we go on to tell of the unexpected and dreadful
experience that now came upon him, we must record
one or two minor incidents of his capture.</p>

<p>One is the behaviour of Mr. Kama Mobamba. He
watched the closing incidents in the restaurant with a
growing amazement upon his great bronze face. Had this
little blue-eyed man been, after all, leading him wrong?
When at last Sargon was led away, Mr. Mobamba moved
at first as though still half inclined to follow him. Then he
stood still, frowned reflectingly and fumbled at his ticket-pocket.
With some effort he produced the sheet of paper
that seemed to be his one intelligible link with London; it
was now in a rather crumpled condition. Smoothing it out
with his great hands, he advanced upon the manager with
it extended.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” said the manager.</p>

<p>The black gentleman bowed with infinite suavity, still
tending his paper. “Non spik English,” said the black
gentleman. “Portugaish. Lean-a-Kay. Lemonallstree.”</p>

<p>He was difficult to direct.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the entrance hall Bobby tacitly denied all
knowledge of Sargon. He was still hovering there with
Billy, held by a curious half-maternal solicitude. The ex-soldiers
had “mizzled,” to use the expressive word of the
man with the organ, at the appearance of policemen; the
man in mourning and his troubles had been cleared up;
but there were still quite a number of people hanging
about in a state of vague anticipation, and the young reporter
was trying to find some one who understood the rare
and obscure language of Oldham in order to verify his
facts. And there were several policemen; one evidently a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
superior officer, a very good-looking man in a peaked cap
and a frogged coat.</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” said Billy, and Sargon was led out.</p>

<p>There was a silence as he passed through the hall to the
rotating door. And upon Sargon, it seemed to Bobby, there
rested a hitherto unnoted dignity. He looked neither to
the right nor the left, and his eyes were exceedingly
mournful.</p>

<p>“But what will they do with him?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know him, sir?” asked the superior
officer abruptly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” said Billy, taking the answer out of Bobby’s
mouth. “Never seen him before. We just came in here to
see what was up.”</p>

<p>And by his silence Bobby acquiesced.</p>

<p>“I’ve got no power to move you on here,” said the police
officer, and smiled a suggestion of inopportuneness to
Billy, and motioned to his satellites that the business there
was at an end.</p>

<p>“We’d better go home,” said Billy, interpreting the smile.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>The three friends sat round a fire in the white room with
the purple curtains, and Bobby poured out his regret that
he had denied Sargon. “They’ve taken him off, Tessy,” he
said for the third time, “and I do not know what they will
do with him.”</p>

<p>“Discharge him with a caution,” said Billy with a drawing-board
on his knee. “He hadn’t committed very much
of an offence that I can see.”</p>

<p>“And then?” said Bobby, and meditated on the fire.</p>

<p>“I shall go round to the police-court and try to pick him
up again afterwards if they let him go,” he said presently.</p>

<p>“Better leave it all alone,” said Billy.</p>

<p>But Tessy sat in her arm-chair between Billy and the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
and looked at Bobby’s preoccupied profile rather sweetly
out of the warm shadow. And nobody in the world saw
her.</p>

<p>“They’ll warn him and he’ll come back here of his own
accord, Bobby,” said Tessy comfortingly.</p>

<p>“Of course he’ll come back,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Very likely, Tessy,” said Bobby. “But suppose they
don’t.”</p>

<p>He got up and stood by the fire. “I suppose I ought to go
upstairs and do some work.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you had,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“How is the novel getting on?” asked Tessy.</p>

<p>“Not much done yet,” said Bobby. “The Prophet has
disorganized the actual writing. But I’ve learnt a lot of
things that will tell some day. And of course I have to
do all my Aunt Suzannah stuff. Aunt Suzannah gets more
and more popular. You can’t imagine the things they ask
me. It’s all material in the long run. Still—it takes
time.... I suppose they’ve locked him in a beastly little
cell somewhere. And he’s wondering why they don’t see
that he’s truly the great Sargon, come again to this
world.... Billy, the world’s a dangerous place, a dangerous,
unkind place. Why couldn’t they let him rip a bit?
And his poor little map of the Whole World upstairs—he
always called it the Whole World—and his little paper
star-machine, and his poor little empty room and his poor
little empty bed.”</p>

<p>“I protest,” said Billy, putting his drawing-board aside.
“Bobby, you are a case of morbid overgrowth of the sympathies.
You are a new disease. You are the type case of
Bobbyism. It’s bad enough that you should sympathize
openly with that little devil Susan when I have spanked
her, and so undo all my teaching. It’s bad enough that
you should do about a third of Mrs. Richman’s work
because she needs light and air. I can even understand
something of your emotional relationships with various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
stray cats and pigeons. But when it comes to your being
sorry for a poor little empty lodging-house bed, I draw the
line. Absolutely, Bobby; I draw the line. Poor little
empty bed! It’s—it’s <i>morbid</i>, Bobby.”</p>

<p>“But of course he was thinking of Sargon,” said Tessy.
“You’ll go to the police-court to-morrow, Bobby?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go—in spite of Billy. I don’t care if it is a disease.
I’m worried about that little man. I’m afraid. He’s too
round-eyed for this cruel world.”</p>

<p>And next morning Bobby went. He went to Lemon
Square Court and sat through a frowsty morning and
waited for Sargon who never appeared. He heard all the
morning “drunks” and suchlike come up for judgment, a
case about stolen soda-water syphons, two matrimonial
differences, and all about the wilful smashing of a plate-glass
window with intent to rob, but nothing about Sargon.
The magistrate vanished and the court began to disperse.
He asked questions of a policeman who had never heard of
Sargon and the little trouble at the Rubicon Restaurant.
Had he come to the right court? the policeman asked.
Bobby hurried headlong to Minton Street. Minton Street,
too, it seemed, had never heard of Sargon. It did not
occur to Bobby to ask in either police station. He retired
baffled. He tried to find something about Sargon in the
evening newspapers; there was not a line about the Rubicon
or him. Perhaps he had not been charged! He hurried
back and rushed upstairs full of a vain surmise; the room
was desolate, the window open, the map of the world on
the floor. Had Sargon been spirited out of existence?</p>

<p>Next day brought neither Sargon nor news of Sargon.
Bobby lay awake of nights.</p>

<p>After three full days Billy, who had been watching his
friend furtively, remarked in a casual manner: “Why don’t
you go and see the Head Panjandrum at the Lemon Square
Police Station about it? He’d be sure to know if anyone
does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Shown in to Inspector Mullins, Bobby found himself confronted
by the same good-looking officer he had seen in the
entrance hall of the Rubicon Restaurant. “You’re the
young man who didn’t happen to know anything about
him, three nights ago,” said Inspector Mullins, not answering
Bobby’s questions.</p>

<p>Bobby explained the situation candidly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t help much now,” said the Inspector. “Still it’s
all in order. We took him, in the exercise of our discretion,
to the Workhouse Infirmary—for observation as to his
mental state. Three clear days they keep them there.
Then they’re either certified or let go. Or charged.”</p>

<p>“Certified?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“As a lunatic,” said Inspector Mullins.</p>

<p>“And what happened to him?”</p>

<p>“Usual thing, I suppose. He was a pretty clear case. By
this time he’s a certified lunatic, I suppose, and either at
Cummerdown Hill or on his way there. Or if that’s full—somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” said Bobby. “Pretty quick.”</p>

<p>He sat disconcerted. “Can I go and see him at Cummerdown
Hill?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” said Inspector Mullins. “Seeing you’re
not a relation.”</p>

<p>“I’m interested in him.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t your business.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But I like him. And I don’t think he’s exactly
mad.... Seems odd of his people—Do you know anything
about his people? I might go and talk to them about
him.”</p>

<p>“That’s possible,” said the Inspector. “I don’t know who
they are. You might find out at the Workhouse Infirmary
or they might tell you from Cummerdown. I don’t know.
Very likely <i>they</i> don’t know who his relations are. There’s
all sorts of such stragglers in the world. Possibly he hasn’t
any relations—the sort of relations, I mean, who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
want to bother about him. My impression is that once a
man or woman is certified and put away it’s rather hard
for an outsider to get through. But, as you say, you can
but try. Sorry I can’t tell you any more. I never saw him
myself at all—except as he went past me. Not my affair....
Yes, our usual procedure in such a case.... Oh!
no trouble. Good morning.”</p>

<p>Left sitting squarely, an embodiment of implacable and
indifferent law and rule.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE THIRD<br>

<i>The Journey of Sargon Underneath the World</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">I<small>T</small> has been said in an earlier chapter that Mr. Preemby,
after his wife’s death, was like some seed which germinates
and thrusts out bold and unexpected things. A
new phase in that belated germination began as he walked
through the London streets beside his captor policeman.
If the thing had happened to Mr. Preemby while he was
still Mr. Preemby, it would have been merely a dreadful,
shameful horror. It would have been an insupportable
experience, a thing to regret, a thing to get through and
conceal and if possible obliterate from record and memory.
If, again, it had happened in the early days of Sargon’s
dreams it would have been an occasion for an immense
dramatic improvisation. He would have thought of the
effect upon the spectators and passers-by, he would have
posed and gesticulated and said profound, memorable
words. But some power of growth had taken possession of
him now and he did none of these things. He posed now
neither to the world without nor to himself within. For
the first time in his life almost he was looking directly at
himself and at what he had done and what had befallen
him, and so full of wonder was he at this ultimate discovery
of reality that he forgot all the vast fabric of make-believe,
imaginative response, and deliberate self-delusion,
up which he had clambered to this new phase of vision.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
He walked so quietly through the lit streets that only the
most observant noted he was in charge and that the policeman
was on duty; to the rest he might have been any
casual companion of a home-going policeman.</p>

<p>One determination had been released in this renascent
mind with an extraordinary strength and clearness, that he
was not, and never would again be, that Albert Edward
Preemby who had launched him into existence. He was a
being called, it mattered not what, in reality, but for his
present purposes, Sargon, Sargon the Magnificent King.
The first concrete visions of Sumeria and his ancient
glories had passed now into the background of his mind.
He had not lost his belief in them at all, but they were now
ancient history to him, and even the revelation at the
boarding house seemed very far away. His ideas had
travelled long distances and gathered much in the past
week. The expectation of an immediate sensational splendour
had been rudely shattered. The Power that had called
him had surprised him exceedingly, but had not overwhelmed
him. He knew quite clearly that he had to be
Sargon who lived not for himself but for the Whole World,
and that to relinquish or deny that was to perish utterly.
It had not seemed to be necessary to him that his own
faith should be tried, but manifestly the Power had determined
that it should be tried. And manifestly he was to be
put through some austere process of preparation before
he entered into his Empire. He was to know what prison
was and to stand a trial. He would be asked to deny
himself.</p>

<p>What should he say to them? I am not He—I am not
Him—which was it? I am not Him you suppose I am.
He muttered it to himself.</p>

<p>“Whassay?” said the policeman.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Is it much further?” asked Sargon.</p>

<p>It was just round the corner. Sargon found himself in a
little austere room with half a dozen quite amiable but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
slightly disrespectful men in uniform. He was asked his
name and address by one who sat at a table. “Sargon,” he
said. “Sargon the First.”</p>

<p>“No Christian name?”</p>

<p>“Pre-Christian,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“No given name, I mean,” said the questioner.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And the address?”</p>

<p>“None at present.”</p>

<p>“Just anywhere?”</p>

<p>Sargon did not answer.</p>

<p>“Case for Gifford Street,” said a voice behind him.</p>

<p>“Memory case or something,” said the man at the table.
“Anyhow, it’s Gifford Street.”</p>

<p>Sargon reflected. “What’s Gifford Street?” he asked.</p>

<p>“’Ospital. Where they’ll give you a bit of a rest and
quiet.”</p>

<p>“But I want to meet a magistrate in open court. I have
a message. I am in no need of rest or quiet.”</p>

<p>“They’ll tell you all about that at Gifford Street. Buxton,
will you take ’im round?”</p>

<p>“But I am perfectly well! Why should I go to
hospital?”</p>

<p>“Routine I suppose,” said the seated policeman and gave
his mind to other things.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>Queer! Why should it be a hospital? The way the
Power was treating him was a strange way. He had to
submit to the Power; he had to maintain himself Sargon.
Still he could have wished for more explicitness.</p>

<p>He was so turned inward now that he went along beside
Constable Buxton, not noting the streets nor the traffic
nor the passers-by. Presently they were at a door in a high
wall, within which there were buildings. Then they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
in a little office and a large, grey-faced porter looked at
him and exchanged muttered explanations with the constable.
Then they were going across a wide yard and
through large doors into a corridor where there was an
unoccupied stretcher and two or three nurses in uniform.
They came to a little glazed-in office and Sargon was asked
to sit down on a bench against a wall while there was
telephoning. Constable Buxton hovered down the corridor
as though the task was nearly done.</p>

<p>A small bright-eyed man in a grey suit came and looked
at Sargon. For some moments they regarded each other
in silence. “Well?” said the man in the grey suit.</p>

<p>“My name is Sargon. I do not know why I have been
brought here. Is this a hospital? I understand it is. I am
not ill.”</p>

<p>“You may be ill without knowing it.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“We just want to have you here for a bit to have a look
at you.”</p>

<p>Sargon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>A very big man with exaggerated shoulders and a large,
clean-shaven, intensely self-satisfied looking face appeared.
He had a wide, thin-lipped mouth, protruding grey eyes
and highly oiled and entirely subjugated sandy hair with
an army “quif” on the forehead.</p>

<p>“Busy evening,” he said. “This is number three.”</p>

<p>“Pretty full then,” said the small man in grey.</p>

<p>“Too full,” said Mr. Jordan, “You don’t know where you
are. This <i>’im</i>?” he asked and indicated Sargon by creasing
his thick neck and depressing the corner of his mouth
towards him.</p>

<p>“This,” said the little man in grey to Sargon, “is Mr.
Jordan. He’s going to show you just where you have to
go and just what you have to do.”</p>

<p>Immediately, instinctively, Sargon disliked Mr. Jordan.
But he stood up obediently because his idea of submission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
to the Power seemed in some way to overlap and include
this new coercion. Mr. Jordan produced a voice of flat,
oily, insincere amiability. “You come along, Old Chap,
with me,” he said. “We’ll make you comfortable all right
’fyou don’t give no trouble.”</p>

<p>They went round a corner and up a cheerless stone staircase
that turned back on itself; they came to a landing and
double doors with glass panes in them that opened upon a
very long, dark passage lit by a single very remote light.
And suddenly it appeared to Sargon that behind him and
already distant lay that outer world of freedom, the streets
and the lights, the coming and going of people and things,
the endless chance encounters, the events and the spectacle
of life to which the Power had sent him, and before
him were dark and narrow and dreadful experiences. Why
should he turn his back thus voluntarily on the great outer
world he had come to save? Was this again only another
mistake he was making? He took a step or so away
from Jordan and faced him.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I do not want to go further into this
place. I do not wish it. Let me return. I have disciples
to call and many things to do.”</p>

<p>The full moon of Jordan’s face displayed incredulous
astonishment that passed into fierceness. “<i>Wot?</i>” he said.</p>

<p>He left a tremendous pause after “Wot” and then spoke
very rapidly. “None of your tricks <i>’ere</i>, you thundering
old Bastard.” With a swift movement his huge, raw, red
hand gripped Sargon by the upper arm. His thin lips were
retracted to show his teeth; his eyes seemed popping out.
He gripped not to hold but to pinch and compress and
injure, and he dug his fingers in between muscle and bone,
so that Sargon stared at him with dilated eyes and uttered
a sharp, involuntary cry of pain.</p>

<p>The grip relaxed from the acutely painful to the merely
uncomfortable, and the big face came down close to Sargon’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
It was manifest that Mr. Jordan had been regaling
himself on cheese and cocoa. “Don’t you try it on, you
Old Fool! Don’t you blooming well try it on. Whatever
it is, don’t you try it on ’ere. You’re right enough to
understand what I say. See? You do exactly wot you’re
told ’ere. You do exactly wot you’re told. You do your
best to avoid givin’ trouble and I’ll do my best ditto. But
if you start doin’ tricks—Gawd ’elp you! See?”</p>

<p>And he crushed the arm again.</p>

<p>“Understan’?”</p>

<p>The blue eyes seemed to assent.</p>

<p>“Down that passage, blast you!” said Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p>A distressed and wondering and yet not absolutely abject
Sargon was taken to a wet and untidy bathroom in which
a broken chair, pools of water, great splashings on the wall,
and some crumpled towels in the corner suggested a recent
struggle. There he was made to undress and take a tepid
bath, dried with a towel that had already been in action,
put into a grey nightgown that was doubtfully clean, a
grey shoddy dressing-gown that certainly wasn’t, and a
pair of down-at-heel slippers two sizes too big, and so
garbed, was led by Mr. Jordan, a little propitiated now
by alert obedience, into the ward in which he was to pass
the night.</p>

<p>A rufous man with very light eyelashes appeared.</p>

<p>“’Ere ’e is, Mr. ’Iggs,” said Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p>“I’ve got his bed ready,” said Mr. Higgs. “’Ow many
more of ’em?”</p>

<p>“Perfec’ shower of ’em,” said Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p>“Three,” said Mr. Higgs.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Jordan. “So long.”</p>

<p>“So long,” said Mr. Higgs.</p>

<p>Neither of them addressed the Lord of the Whole World
directly. He might have been a parcel passed from hand
to hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>When Sargon entered the Observation Ward of the
Gifford Street Infirmary his sense of having left life, ordinary
current life, far away behind him, beyond these grey
passages and corridors and staircases and glass offices
and high walls and little doors, was enormously reinforced.
Never had he seen anything so emptily bleak and cheerless
as this place. A heartless great dingy room it was, with
green-grey distempered walls discoloured in patches, lit
by a few bare lights that gave neither high-lights nor
shadows. Black night and a greasily lit brick wall stared
in through uncurtained windows. Half-way down the
length of the place projecting pieces of wall suggested
that two former rooms had been thrown into one. The
floor was of polished bare boards. Far off was a table
set against the wall with two or three torn and crumpled
magazines thereon, and at the end an empty fire-place. In
the near half, on either side, there were iron bedsteads
in rows, twenty or thirty perhaps altogether. There was
a foul smell in the air, faint and yet indescribably offensive,
a fæcal smell mixed with a heavy soapy odour.</p>

<p>Even had it been unoccupied, this cold, large, evil-smelling
room would have seemed a strange inhospitable place
to Sargon. For it had always been the lot of Mr. Preemby,
even in the days of his early poverty, to live snug, to have
carpets, even if they were shabby carpets, under his feet,
and an encumbrance of furniture and silly human pictures
and brackets and things about him on the walls. Here
in this harsh plainness it was as though the fussy, accumulative,
home-making imagination of man had never been.</p>

<p>But the strange soulless atmosphere of the place was but
the first instant impression of Sargon. It was followed by
a far more vivid and terrible realization, that this place was
inhabited by beings who were only at the first glance men.
Then as one looked again it became clear that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
not exactly men, they did not look up at his entry as men
should, or they showed their awareness of him by queer
unnatural movements. Several were in bed; others were
dressed in shabby and untidy clothes and either sat on
their beds or were seated in chairs about the lower part of
the room. One individual only was in motion; a grave-faced
young man who was walking with an appearance of
concentrated method to and fro in a restricted circle in the
far corner of the ward. Another sat and seemed to remove
a perpetually recurrent cobweb from his face by a perpetually
repeated gesture. Two men were jammed behind
the table against the wall and one, a fleshy lout with a
shining pink skin and curling red hair on his bare chest,
was making violent gestures, hammering the table with a
freckled fist, talking in a voice that rose and sank and
occasionally broke into curses while the other, a sallow-complexioned,
cadaverous individual, seemed to be sunken
in profound despair. In one of the beds close at hand a
young man with a shock of black hair and an expression
of fatuous satisfaction, that changed with dramatic suddenness
to triumphant fierceness or insinuating lucidity,
sat up and gesticulated and composed and recited an interminable
poem—something in the manner of Browning. It
was running in this fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>“There’s your bed,” said Mr. Higgs at Sargon’s elbow,
shoving him slightly.</p>

<p>Sargon moved a little unwillingly, his puzzled eyes still
on the talker.</p>

<p>“You’ll hear enough of him before you’re done, Old
Chap,” said Mr. Higgs. “Hop into bed now.”</p>

<p>Impelled partly by the arm of Mr. Higgs and partly by
his natural disposition to please, Sargon got into bed. Mr.
Higgs assisted him in a rough brotherly fashion. But
before Sargon could pull up the clothes about him, Mr.
Higgs, glancing over his shoulder, became aware of something
that was happening down the room—Sargon could
not see what.</p>

<p>In an instant the genial authoritativeness of Mr. Higgs
gave way to rage. “Yaaps, you dirty old devil!” said Mr.
Higgs. “You’re at it again!”</p>

<p>He quitted Sargon and ran down the room very swiftly.
Sargon sat up in bed to see what was happening. Three
or four of the other patients did the same. A very dirty
old man with a face of extreme misery, who was sitting in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
a chair, was seized upon and bumped up and down and hit
several times with great vigour by Mr. Higgs. Then Mr.
Higgs departed and returned, still uttering admonitions,
with a pail and a rag.</p>

<p>For Mr. Higgs was not only an attendant on the mentally
afflicted but also, on account of economy, the floor-scrubber
and general cleaner of the ward. He had been
trained in the navy to ideals of a speckless brightness and
he scrubbed better than he attended.</p>

<p>“Lie down there!” cried Mr. Higgs returning up the ward
with his pail. “It ain’t nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p>The Lord of the World lay down.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>It was an extremely uninteresting ceiling to look at
except for a streak of yellowish stains, but it was better to
look at the ceiling for a time than to look too much at
these distressing people around him. They were distressing
and distracting, and Sargon knew that it was urgently
necessary not to be distracted, but to think over his position
very carefully before anything further happened to
him. All this rush of consequences had been so unexpected,
preposterous and violent since—a few hours ago—he had
surveyed London from the dome of Saint Paul’s and
decided that the moment had come to take hold of his
Lordship of the World, that he perceived he might very
conceivably be overwhelmed. How serene and distant
now was that spectacle of London spread out under the
amber sunshine between its far blue hills and its shining
river, with its dense clusters of shipping and the black ant-currents
of folk below. From that he had come swiftly,
inevitably, to this echoing prison. For prison he saw it
was. He knew quite well that these men around him were
demented men and that he had been seized upon as a
lunatic, but he thought that the Workhouse Observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Ward in which he was, was a lunatic asylum already. In
his wildest imaginations he had never imagined the Power
over all things could treat him thus. The possibility of a
brief interlude in prison, of a severe but very public and
triumphant trial, had entered his mind; but not that he
might be hustled away out of the possibility of any such
appeal. He had to think his position out anew, to discover
what all this monstrous experience was intended to show
and to teach him, and what he had to do to meet this
strange occasion.</p>

<p>And it was very difficult to do this with a raucous voice
down the room uttering foul threats about the ward
attendant and a great fist beating the table in sudden
storms and with that smooth, fluctuating, unending recitation
nearer at hand, that cosmic poem, now almost
inaudible—so that one strained to catch the words—and
now in high-pitched delight. For long stretches it was
just incoherent jumble and Sargon would hold it almost
completely out of his attention while he pursued his own
perplexities, and then it would rush together into something
that challenged its way to mingle with his inmost
thoughts.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Filthy old Nature, she drives us amain;</div>
<div class="verse">One goad is lust and the other goad pain.</div>
<div class="verse">And so we get back to old nowhere again.</div>
<div class="verse">Nowhere to start from and nowhere again.</div>
<div class="verse">Want and be hurt, want and be hurt,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the dirt you came, back to the dirt.</div>
<div class="verse">Hunger for dirt and dirty regretting</div>
<div class="verse">Dirty our feeding and dirty begetting</div>
<div class="verse">Smear yourself, paint yourself, wear a fine shirt</div>
<div class="verse">Put a brave face on it, Yah!—you are dirt.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Now is that true?” asked Sargon of himself. Is that
true? Dirt? What is dirt? But no! he must not wander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
off after this mad raving! What was it he had been thinking
about? He had been asking why had the Power thrust
him into this dreadful place? Why had the Power brought
him to this place? If only the man would stop that improvisation
of his for a little while it might be possible
to think that out. Why had he been given over to the
commands of Jordan and Higgs to live among the madmen
and—sudden fantastic side question!—why had <i>they</i>?</p>

<p>If only that poem would cease! If only that voice would
fade to silence! It was now mere rubble and rubbish, as
though thought had been broken up with a pickaxe and
loaded in carts and shot down a slope. Don’t listen to it,
Sargon! Don’t listen to it! Concentrate!</p>

<p>In his endeavour to concentrate, Sargon forgot even
Higgs. He sat up in bed and drew his knees nearly to
his chin and thought.</p>

<p>He was Sargon; that was the great issue. He had to
remain Sargon. He was probably in this place of trouble
and torment because of the conflict between his being
Sargon and the possibility of his relapsing into Preemby.
The Power had called him to be Sargon and to serve and
suffer for and at last to rule the Whole World, but manifestly
it was not a simple direct call. There was something
working in opposition to this destiny, an Anti-Power,
opposed to the Power, which was trying to put him back
to Preemby and Preembyism, to being little and insignificant,
to living obscurely and to no purpose and so at
last to dying and becoming utterly and finally dead. That
Anti-Power it was that had been permitted to bring him
here, to frighten and torment him, to din mad rhymes
into his ears, to urge upon him in a monotonous persistent
voice that he was dirt and that God was without a face,
and a multitude of suchlike blasphemies. But they were
not true. The Anti-Power might talk and talk—would
God there could be a respite from his talking!—but the
truth was outside this place and greater than this place and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
altogether comprehended it. He was one, Sargon was one,
from the beginning in Sumeria, in many lands and now
here, the same spirit, the ruler who serves; he was one just
as London was one when it was seen from on high up above
there, endlessly multitudinous yet drawn together into a
single personality. And so was the whole world one. To
be Preemby was to be like a wretched little back street
house down below there, swallowed up in the general effect.
Never more could he be Preemby, even if he would. That
was what he had to keep hold of. He could only be
Sargon by denying Preemby—even though he had to face
the pains of death.</p>

<p>Yet all the while the Anti-Power was insulting life and
himself through that disordered poet and his recitation.
The man had now fallen under the spell of a fascinating
but detestable word, if one may call such a thing a word,
“Tra-la-la.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Tra-la-la. Tra-la-la.</div>
<div class="verse">That is the note of it.</div>
<div class="verse">Get the full gloat of it.</div>
<div class="verse">Tra-la-la. Tra-la-la.</div>
<div class="verse">All times and places</div>
<div class="verse">Happy derision for Gods without faces.</div>
<div class="verse">Tra-la-la sunshine or Tra-la-la rain.</div>
<div class="verse">Eat, drink, and kiss ’em and at it again.</div>
<div class="verse">Tra-la-la. Tra-la-la.</div>
<div class="verse">Kiss ’em and Kiss ’em and at it again.</div>
<div class="verse">At it again!</div>
<div class="verse">Tra-la-la.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He varied his recitation with a loud explosive noise made
by his lips on the back of his hand.</p>

<p>“Pray don’t think me cynical,” he said to Sargon. “It is
just pure Joy de Vive.”</p>

<p>Sargon could not stand it any longer. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
damnable teaching to fling out before the very regenerator
of mankind. He suddenly thrust out a pointing finger.
“You are wrong!” he said loudly and sharply.</p>

<p>The poet stared for a minute and with a gesture of
salutation said: “Tra-la-la-la.”</p>

<p>“I tell you life is real,” cried Sargon. “Life is immense.
Life is full of meaning and order. I have come to tell you
and all men so.”</p>

<p>The poet interrupted smilingly and politely with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Tra-la-la</div>
<div class="verse">Tra-la-la</div>
<div class="verse">Life is a hiccup and life is a sneeze</div>
<div class="verse">A smell from a dunghill borne on the breeze</div>
<div class="verse">A thing of no moment—so do as you please!</div>
<div class="verse">Tra-la-la. Tra-la-la.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He was going on, but Sargon would not hear him. He
lifted his voice to drown his antagonist. “I tell you, you
poor soul! you are utterly wrong and blind,” he said. “For
the light has come to me and understanding is mine. You
are not the lost thing you deem you are, or at least you
need not be. No! I, too, was a lost thing such as you are, a
little while ago. I, too, thought I was a grain, a fragment, a
thing of no account. But the call has come to me, and I
have been called to call others to take part with me in a
new awakening. I have had a vision and I have seen the
world like one who awakens from a long sleep. All things
are joined together and work together and continue for
ever.”</p>

<p>The poet wrinkled up his nose and waved his hand at
Sargon as who should wave aside some object of offence.
“Tra-la-la,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“All things I tell you are joined together and work
together——”</p>

<p>“Tra-la-la,” louder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“I tell you,” much louder.</p>

<p>“Shuddup there,” cried the loud and wrathful voice of
Sanity embodied in Mr. Higgs.</p>

<p>“You’ll have the whole ward jabbering in a minute,”
said Mr. Higgs, approaching and addressing Sargon in
tones of earnest expostulation. “Shud Dup.”</p>

<p>And after a brief pause of reflection the Lord of the
Whole World obeyed.</p>

<p>With a gesture of extreme dignity he indicated to Higgs
that his crude demands were conceded.</p>

<p>“That’s o right,” said Higgs. “<i>You</i> can hold in if you
want to. So you better. <i>He</i> can’t.”</p>

<p>The poet went on in a soft insinuating undertone
reviling and mocking Sargon’s faith to a refrain of:
“Tra-la-la. Tra-la-la.”</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Sargon sat up in bed, motionless now except that his head
turned slowly to look at the people about him, and silent.
His recent outbreak had in some way assuaged the exasperation
of that endless recitation. It continued, now
crazily persuasive, now strident and vehement, now a mere
babble of words, it flowed past him and over him; it was
now manifestly directed at him, but he was able to disregard
it. He sat up and looked at the people about him
and contemplated the vast dreadful hours that plainly lay
before him.</p>

<p>He did not look beyond the coming night. That alone
he foresaw as an eternity.</p>

<p>He knew that this harsh, naked electric light which prized
up his eyelids however tightly he closed them, would be
glaring all night; he knew that because he had noted a
glance that Higgs had directed at the violent man with red
hair. Instantly he knew that Higgs was afraid of that red-haired
man with the shining pink skin and would never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
dare to have the ward in darkness, never dare to have even
shade in it, whatever the custom or the regulations might
be. And also he understood why ever and again Higgs
went out of the room at the upper end; he went out to
assure himself of the presence of Jordan or some such
other helper, within call. Yes, this light would certainly
keep on all night and the poet seemed as likely to keep on,
and there would be occasional outbreaks of table hammering
and shouting from the red-haired man and from another
man who uttered a sudden flat shout ever and again. And
there would be misadventures of various sorts; noises and
comings and goings. So he might just as well sit up and
think as lie down and make hopeless attempts to slumber.
One could always think. Of course if one was too tired
one would cease thinking onward, one would just think
round and round, but it would be impossible not to go
on waking and thinking. There was no sleeping in this
place. Eyes, ears, nose were all too much offended. Did
anyone ever sleep here, mad or sane?</p>

<p>There was nothing for him to do, therefore, but to sit up
and think, sit up and think, doze perhaps and think into a
dream, until some unexpected jolt or jar brought him back
to his thinking.</p>

<p>The longest night must end at last.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Sargon, between sleeping and waking, saw
something horrible. At least it struck upon his nerves as
horrible. Two beds away from him there lay an extremely
emaciated young man and his head was lifted up. It was
not supported by pillows; it was six inches above the
pillow. It was held up in an attitude that it was painful
to realize. The young man’s face expressed a serenely
proud satisfaction at this fantastic rigidity. It was incredible.
Was there such a thing as an invisible pillow? Or
was this a delusion of Sargon’s eyes, a waking dream?</p>

<p>In the bed beyond another man was lying down with his
wakeful face towards Sargon. His eyes met Sargon’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
Neither man said a word nor made a gesture, but to each
came infinite comfort. For the eyes each encountered were
as sane as his own and each gave support to the other. It
is so, they said. It is strange, but your eyes are not deceiving
you. That is the form of that young man’s affliction.</p>

<p>Sargon nodded. The other sane man nodded in reply
and then turned over in his bed as a reassured child might
do, to sleep. But could he sleep?</p>

<p>Sargon’s gaze went round the ward with a new discovery.
Yes, several of these others might be sane—sane as he was—and
caught like himself. There was another man across
the corridor with a little beard, a very, very mournful man,
but he also had sane eyes.</p>

<p>To-morrow Sargon must go and talk to these others and
tell them about himself and discuss this dreadful situation,
but not now because Higgs would certainly interfere.
Many things had already conspired to annoy Higgs. It
was plain he could be easily irritated and it would be well
not to annoy him further. For the present one must just
sit and think.</p>

<p>What were the mad and what did madness mean?</p>

<p>Why had he been lifted up by the Supreme Power, out of
the common acts and imaginations of his daily life, to a
knowledge of his immortal being, why had he been shown
his endless destinies and a vision of the whole world as
his sphere, merely to be cast out of life and light and
freedom forthwith into this grey underworld of the
demented? It could not be that this was for nothing. It
must signify.</p>

<p>And then the wind of a second question blew across his
mind. The Power that had called him and called him it
would seem only to bring him into this place, had also
brought all these others to this same dreadfulness. <i>Why?</i>
For him it might be a trial but what was it for these others,
whose souls had indeed dissolved and gone? What was the
Power doing with them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The whole scheme of things in Sargon’s mind began to
shudder and dissolve. If the Power had not done this, then
it must be the Anti-Power had done it. There must be an
Anti-Power as strong almost as the Power then, able to
snatch men out of life into confusion, indignity, and death
for ever. Or else—<i>there was Nothing</i>!</p>

<p>He sat quite still with his chin on his knuckles and eyes
staring blankly at the last black possibility.</p>

<p>Was the whole of this call and this mission of his a deception
and a delusion? Had he been cheated at Tunbridge
Wells when the call first came to him to arise and awake?
Were those memories of Sumeria no more than dreams?
Was he indeed just Albert Edward Preemby—gone crazy?
In a crazy, pointless universe of commonplace inanities?
If so he was indeed the most foolish of living men. He had
left his comfort and securities, sound though insignificant;
he had run away from his dear Christina Alberta—to obey
a Power that was nothing more than his own imagination
and to follow a phantom end. For days he had been
shutting Christina Alberta out of his thoughts; she was a
sceptic, an ally of the Anti-Power. Now she came back,
over-valiant and rash, but just a girl. He had left her to
shift for herself, left her beyond reach of his reproofs and
cautions. What was she doing? What evil and danger
might not be overtaking her even now? It had not occurred
to him before that his disappearance might distress
and endanger her. Now he saw plainly that it must
have done so.</p>

<p>The enemy came and argued frankly with him. “You
have been a fool, Albert Edward Preemby,” said the
enemy. “You have got yourself into a position of great
danger and discomfort, you have deserted your own proper
life for a horror of nothingness. Go back. Go back while
there is still a chance of going back.”</p>

<p>But could he go back?</p>

<p>Yes. That could be done. So easily! He could say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
plainly that now he remembered his proper name. He
could ask to see the doctor or the director or whoever it
was presided over Jordan and Higgs and their colleagues;
he could give his name and the address of the studio and
his bankers’ address and the address of the laundry and
so forth, speaking very plainly and quietly, he could admit
that he had behaved strangely but that the fit was over,
and so he would pass out of these grim shadows back
into the world. It would rejoice the heart of Christina
Alberta....</p>

<p>He thought of that alert, kind, slightly antagonistic
figure. If only he could see it now! Coming down the
long ward to him, to rescue, to release....</p>

<p>Then he would be just Preemby again for the rest of his
days, comfortably Preemby, Preemby the bystander,
Preemby the onlooker, the ineffective, speechless man in
the background of the noisy studio. But certain things
would be at an end. He would never go to any museums
again or browse in the dark shadows of book-shops over
dusty forgotten books about vanished cities and enigmatical
symbols. He would think no more of the wonder
and mystery of Atlantis and of the measurements of the
Pyramids and of all the high riddles of the past and the
future. There would be no more wonder in his life at
all, for he had sought to enter into wonder and had found
it delusion. Those things would be old tales and fancies
of things that would never arrive. Past and future would
be dead for him. The days would be dull and empty as
they had never been before. The bladder of his life would
be pricked....</p>

<p>And the other way lay pain, indignity, rough treatment,
vile food, filthy circumstances, trials that might break him—but
with the Power still beckoning.</p>

<p>He thought of the things that belonged to Sargon; of the
Power, of cities that were like great single persons, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Whole World, of the mystical promise of the stars, of all
these things he must renounce now and be Preemby,
Preemby plain and sensible, to the end of his days, if he
would go out of this place. He sat at it seemed to him for
an immense time, still and brooding, though his answer
was already definite in his mind. And at last he spoke.
“No,” he said in a hoarse voice that was almost a shout.
“I am Sargon, Sargon the servant of God—and the Whole
World is mine!”</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>Long after midnight Sargon was still sitting up in that
bleak greasy glare amidst the noises and disorder about
him. He had lost all count of time; his watch had been
taken from him. Somewhen in the small hours he was
praying. And at times he wept a little.</p>

<p>He prayed. Sometimes he made sentences and whispered
them to himself and sometimes the sentences never got to
words but passed through his mind like serpents that are
seen through deep, dark water. “Great is the task thou hast
put upon me. I see now I am not worthy, O Master, to do
the least thing that is required of me. I am not worthy. I
am a petty man and a foolish man and all I have done so
far is folly. But thou hast called me, knowing my folly.
Forgive thou my folly and help thou my faith.” Silent and
still he sat with tears upon his cheeks. “Any punishment
and any trial,” he whispered at last, “only that thou
shouldst not desert me and vanish out of my world.”</p>

<p>He prayed that the Power would yet make him the
servant of the world and added falteringly and feebly,
“even as it was in the ancient days.”</p>

<p>For had there even been those ancient days? Sumeria
was now very far away from him, and the white towns and
the blue river and the river galleys had faded and the worshipping
crowds were just a faint smear upon his mind no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
stranger than the fading memory of a dream. He said
nothing for a time, and then in a very loud whisper he said:
“Help thou my unbelief.”</p>

<p>Sometimes he prayed in a whisper and sometimes he
prayed silently and sometimes he sat quite still. Higgs
came and looked at him once or twice but did not interfere
with him. The poem in the adjacent bed still went on, but
it had now become a mere rhyming stream of blasphemous
obscenities.</p>

<p>For a time after he had made an end to his praying,
Sargon must have slept; he must have slept because he
was awakened by the dawn. It did not come gradually; he
awoke to it.</p>

<p>A cold, shadowless light filled the ward and the electric
lamps that had seemed so bright were just luminous
orange-yellow threads. And Higgs was standing in the
doorway peering intently at the red-haired man, who was
lying with his head on the table as though he were asleep—but
perhaps only pretending to be asleep.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>It was on the afternoon of the following day that two
strangers came to see Sargon. He was taken to them and
they talked a little with him, and then chiefly with each
other. Higgs was off duty but Jordan hovered in the background.</p>

<p>Neither of these gentlemen explained their business with
Sargon to him. One of them was a short man in a black
coat; he wore a gold watch-chain and a rich-looking tie
with a jewelled pin; he had a gold pince-nez, a little
pointed nose, a fat, clean-shaven white face, and a mouth
like an oblique spade-thrust in a lump of dough. He spoke
with something between a sniff and a lisp, and he was evidently
rather in a hurry and annoyed at having been called
in to see Sargon. The other was large and grey and worn-looking;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
he impressed Sargon in some indefinable way as
being a medical man who had private troubles. He seemed
to consider himself in charge of the conversation, and would
occasionally refer upon some point of fact to the hovering
Jordan.</p>

<p>“Understand,” said the pasty-faced man, “you wanted to
give some sort of dinner party to all sorts of people. Eh?—at
the Rubicon. I suppose it came on you sort of sudden
like. Eh?”</p>

<p>“I wished to confer with certain people,” said Sargon.
“It may have been a mistake on my part.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it was a mistake, Mr.—Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Won’t ’ave a Mister to it,” said Jordan from the background.
“Calls ’isself Sargon.”</p>

<p>The doctor became very acute in his manner. “Now isn’t
that some sort of historical name?” he asked with a sideways
searching look.</p>

<p>“It is,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t <i>your</i> name, you know.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not. I mean—It is my only name.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bit of an answer, that is,” said the pasty-faced
man. “My <i>word</i>!”</p>

<p>“What is your <i>real</i> name?” asked the doctor persuasively.</p>

<p>“Sargon.”</p>

<p>“Not Mr. A. E. Preemby?”</p>

<p>Sargon started and stared, possibly with a certain wildness
in his eyes. “With God’s help, <i>No</i>!” he said.</p>

<p>“Was it ever Mr. Preemby?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“That does not matter now. That is of no importance
now.”</p>

<p>“It may be of <i>some</i> importance,” said the pasty-faced
man.</p>

<p>“And now you’re a King or a Lord or something and you
own the world?” said the doctor.</p>

<p>Sargon made no answer. He felt he was in a net.</p>

<p>The doctor turned to Jordan and beckoned him in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
whisper. Only one sentence came to Sargon’s ears. “’Iggs
’eard it,” said Mr. Jordan.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you called Sargon the Magnificent?” asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>Sargon bent his head in sorrow. “Better were it to call
me Sargon the Unworthy. For in many things I have
failed.”</p>

<p>The pasty-faced man looked at the doctor. “Haven’t we
had about enough of this?”</p>

<p>“My conclusions are clear,” said the doctor. “In fact, I
have the certificate ready.”</p>

<p>“If you’re satisfied, Dr. Manningtree, I am. If I’m to
see those other fellers.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got all the papers in my room,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Right-o,” said the pasty-faced man.</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you to come to-day. I wouldn’t have
bothered you until to-morrow but we are really getting
overcrowded here. One chap’s decidedly dangerous. The
attendants here don’t like the look of him. You need
only just see him for a moment. Or any of them. All
clear cases for summary reception orders.”</p>

<p>They spoke now as if Sargon were not present or as if he
were an inanimate object. And indeed for them he had
become so; he had passed for them already out of the
comity of mankind.</p>

<p>“Why have you been talking to me?” asked Sargon suddenly
with a vague fear of what had been said and done
developing in his mind.</p>

<p>The doctor’s manner altered. He spoke to Sargon as one
might speak to a small child. “You’ll be going back to bed
now,” he said. “Jordan!”</p>

<p>“But I want to know.”</p>

<p>“Go with Mr. Jordan.”</p>

<p>“What are these papers you speak about?”</p>

<p>The doctor turned his back on Sargon without an answer
and the man with the pasty face opened the door to depart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
Sargon made a step towards them, but Jordan laid hold of
his arm.</p>

<p>And while Sargon was being steered back to bed, firmly
rather than gently, in the grip of Jordan, the justice and
the doctor filled in and signed the forms that were necessary
to deprive him of nearly every right he possessed as a
human being. For there is no trial by jury and no writ of
habeas-corpus in Britain for the unfortunate charged with
insanity. He may not plead in public and there is no one
to whom he may appeal. He may write complaints but
they will be neglected; his most urgent expostulations
will be disregarded in favour of any dull attendant’s
asseverations. He is handed over to the nearly autocratic
control of under-educated, ill-paid, ill-fed, and overworked
attendants. Every night and every day seems endless
to him at first, and then the nights and days fall into
a sort of routine and become unimportant and pass away
more and more rapidly. He is almost always kept in a
state of bodily discomfort, always rather ill from the ill-prepared
and sometimes tainted food, and much incommoded
by clumsy drugging and particularly by the
administration of violent purgatives. In croton oil alone
are our asylums truly generous. He has excellent reason
for fearing many of his fellow inmates and for a servile
obedience to the attendants in charge of him. A medical
superintendent hovers in the background; a medical staff
with no special training in mental science. They pass
through the wards at the appointed times, avoiding trouble,
seeing as little as possible.</p>

<p>And, after all, what can they do? They cannot raise the
expenditure upon food or increase the number or salaries
of the attendants. They are appointed to save and not to
spend the ratepayers’ money. The attendants work together
and protect each other; they must hang together;
many of them go in fear of the violent cases. Occasionally,
after due notice, a visiting magistrate will pay a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
formal visit to the asylum. Everything is put in order for
the occasion. The inmate with a grievance dares not
accost him or does not know how to accost him nor how
to frame his complaint. The attendants are at hand to
interrupt, embarrass, and explain. So, with no possibility
of redress, the poor half-lunatic will be roughly handled,
badly fed, and coarsely clothed, and night and day he will
have no other familiar company than the insane. It is
bad enough for the sane to be afflicted by the vagaries,
the violence, the exasperating mechanisms, the incoherences
of the truly demented, but what must it be for those upon
whom the penumbra of that same shadow has fallen? They
have no privacy; no escape from those others; no peace.
Our world herds these discards together out of sight, walls
them up, spends so little upon them that they are neither
properly fed nor properly looked after, and does its brave
hopeful best to forget all about them.</p>

<p>And our Sargon, who even in the outer world of usage
and freedom was sometimes a little at a loss, must now go
on into this dark underworld. For two days more he will
be kept in the Gifford Street Observation Ward awaiting
the convenience of the authorities; then in the company of
four other prisoners he will be sent to a still bleaker and
more desolate and hopeless confinement within the clustering
buildings and walls and railings of Cummerdown Hill.</p>

<p>So he passes now for a time out of sight of everyday
mankind, and so also for a time he shall pass out of this
story. It would be insufferable to tell with any fulness his
daily tale of discomfort and indignity.</p>

<i>Christina Alberta in Search of a Father</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">H<small>ITHERTO</small> Christina Alberta had faced life with a bold,
disdainful, and successful gesture. The discretions
and scruples of others were not for her. She had seen no
reason for their prudent hesitations, their conventions and
restraints. Now for the first time she knew dismay. Her
Daddy had vanished into a world that she suddenly realized
could be immensely cruel. Teddy was rotten, so plainly
rotten that only a fool wrapped up in her own sensations
would have touched him. She lay awake for most of the
night after her Daddy had vanished, biting her hands and
damning Teddy. Lambone the great friend was lazy, incompetent,
and futile. Harold and Fay seemed already a little
tired of her misfortune and vaguely disposed to blame her
for bringing her Daddy to London. She had no one else
to whom she could turn. No one remained to her—except
Christina Alberta herself, feeling a little soiled now and
more than a little afraid. “But what am I to do?” she
asked the night, again and again, in her stuffy but artistic
little bedroom.</p>

<p>Among the other disadvantages of her position she had
less than a pound of ready money.</p>

<p>It has to be recorded that for two whole days Christina
Alberta did not even take the obvious step of going to the
police. She had a queer instinctive knowledge of the danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
of bringing the police and the social system generally
to bear upon her odd little Daddy. She had an innate
distrust of official human beings. It was Paul Lambone who
induced her to go to the police. He had the grace to
be ashamed of his unhelpfulness, and after an interval of
two clear days he came round to the Lonsdale Mews to
offer his generous but sluggish help once more. He caught
her having tea with Fay.</p>

<p>“Christina Alberta,” he said, looking a very large comfortable
figure of sorrow, “I’ve been worrying and worrying
about you all the time. I didn’t help enough. I thought
he’d come back of his own accord and that all the fuss was
a little premature. Have you heard anything?”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta was torn between the desire to snap
his head off and the realization that he was, after his
fashion, quite sincerely friendly to her and could be very
useful.</p>

<p>“<i>Say</i> it!” said Lambone. “You’ll be better, my dear,
after you’ve said it and then we can talk matters over.”</p>

<p>He got the reassurance of a smile. He brightened visibly.
He was the sort of man who would hate to feel hated
even by a cockroach. “I won’t sit in that chair, thanks,”
he said to Fay. “It’s too comfortable. And at any moment
we may think of something, and I may have to leap up
and act.</p>

<p>“Spartan,” he said, sitting down.</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Fay.</p>

<p>“Spartan. My doctor tells me to say it before every
meal and especially before tea. I don’t know why. Magic
or Coué or something. Are these things cocoanut cakes?
I thought so.... Good they are. And what are we
going to do about it, Christina Alberta?”</p>

<p>He became sane and helpful and more and more like the
man who wrote <i>What to Do on a Hundred and One Occasions</i>.
He made Christina Alberta admit to bankruptcy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and made it clear to her that it was her duty to accept a
loan of twenty-five pounds from him. He then dealt with
the point about reporting the disappearance to the police,
and convinced Christina Alberta upon that. If Mr.
Preemby had fallen into bad hands the sooner the police
looked for him the better. But he did not think that likely;
he was much more inclined to the idea that Preemby had
made a disturbance and been taken up. He guessed he
would be dealt with as a mental case. He had consulted
those useful books <i>The Justice of the Peace</i> and the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, and displayed the excellence of his
mental digestion. Christina Alberta perceived that he had
in him the makings of a competent barrister.</p>

<p>He carried off Christina Alberta in a taxi to Scotland
Yard. “Either they’ll tell us there or tell us where we
shall be told,” he said.</p>

<p>Fay was impressed by the originality of that. “Now
if it was a lost umbrella,” she said, “I could understand it.
But I’d never have thought of going to Scotland Yard for
a lost father.”</p>

<p>By six Mr. Preemby had been traced to Gifford Street.
But there was no seeing him at Gifford Street. He had
been certified as a lunatic and he was bound, the attendant
thought but wasn’t quite sure, for Cummerdown Hill.
Paul Lambone tried to be dignified and important and to
prevail over the attendant and extract further information,
but not very successfully. In the end he and Christina
Alberta departed with little more than one immense discouraging
fact. They would not be able to see Mr.
Preemby nor to learn anything very material about his
condition until the next visiting day, whenever that might
be, at Cummerdown Hill. Then if he was “fit to be visited,”
they might go and see him. The attendant was rigid
in his statements and had the air of disliking both Lambone
and Christina Alberta extremely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>As they came away from Gifford Street Christina Alberta
observed that Lambone was angry. She had never seen
him angry before. It was a very transitory phase. There
was an unusual depth of pink in his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Dog in office,” he said. “Just there to annoy people—anxious
people. One would think ... man in my position ...
certain standing.... Some attention....
Any other country but this, Man of letters has respect.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta agreed mutely.</p>

<p>“Manners in a public official—primary.”</p>

<p>“He was detestable,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Not at the end of my resources,” said Lambone.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta waited.</p>

<p>“Ought to have gone to Devizes in the first place. Knows
more about mental cases and lunacy law than any other
man in London. Wonderful fellow. I’ll go back to my flat
and I’ll ring him up and make an appointment. Then
he’ll put us wise about the whole business. And I want you
to meet him anyhow. You’ll appreciate Devizes. Come to
think of it, you’re remarkably like him.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Got the Life Force and all that. And physically like
him. Very. The same nose—much the same profile.”</p>

<p>“It’s a nose more suitable for a man,” said Christina
Alberta. “I suppose <i>he</i> carries it off all right!”</p>

<p>“It’s a damned good nose, Christina Alberta,” said Lambone.
“It’s a valiant nose. Don’t you break down to any
modesty about it. It was your nose attracted me first to
you. You’ll spike a husband with it yet, and he’ll adore
it and follow it even as you do. Nowadays women have to
be free and individualized; they have got to have features
and distinction. The days of the wanton curl and the swan
neck and complexion have gone. Not that you haven’t the
clearest skin I’ve ever set eyes upon, Christina Alberta.”</p>

<p>“Tell me some more about Dr. Devizes,” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>But it wasn’t the next day that Christina Alberta met
Devizes. She put that off for a day and fled down to
Woodford Wells in response to a remarkable communication
from Mr. Sam Widgery.</p>

<p>The Widgerys had never been correspondents of the
Preembys except in so far as the payment of the dividends
upon Mr. Preemby’s interest in the Limpid Stream
Laundry necessitated letters. There had been a certain
amount of friction in the flotation of the company, and Mr.
Widgery had remained resentful and sought to show as
much by a studied curtness in his communications. But
now came this letter addressed to “Miss Chrissie Preemby.”
“<i>My dear Chrissie</i>,” the letter began.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“<i>This is a shocking business about your poor father I
can’t tell you how shocked I am I went up post haste to
the workhouse where you had put him as soon as they
wrote to me and got his watch and cheque-book. It is
fortunate they found my address in his pocket or I suppose
I should have been kept in the dark as per usual about all
this he did not know me and denied his own name but
afterwards he said he knew me for a filching commercial
wrogue and would have my ears cut off and threatened me.
I was to be unpailed whatever that may be. I have been
thinking over all this business and since you are not yet of
age I suppose I am a sort of guardian to you and have to
look into your interests at the laundry which is not paying
nearly so well as your father led me to believe. I think
he was already queer at the time and didn’t fully understand
what he was doing and I doubt if all that of his
about preference shares which I never held with really but
did to humour him ought to stand. Luckily there is no
hurry about this has you won’t have to pay anything for
him where he is Mr. Punter says so long as you leave well
alone and we can see about these other things when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
have got over the first shock of your father’s breakdown.
My wife sends her love and kind sympathy. You must
keep calm and not let these things disturb you too much
because very often it is hereriterary and one cannot be
too careful so leave everything to me and believe me to
remain</i></p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“<i>Your affectionate cousin</i></span><br>

“<i>Sam Widgery</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Rather!” said Christina Alberta and telephoned forthwith
to put off Paul Lambone and Wilfred Devizes and
hurried off with a combatant light in her eye to the Underground
and Liverpool Street Station.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>When Christina Alberta got down to Woodford Wells it
seemed to her that the laundry was just a little smaller
than it used to be and that a slight tarnish had fallen upon
the bright blue delivery vans. The swastika upon them
had been covered over by paper bills in red lettering
saying: “Under Entirely New Management. Address all
Communications to the Managing Director Samuel Widgery
Esq. By Order.”</p>

<p>She went up the garden path to the door that had been
home to her for nearly all her life, and it was opened to
her by Sam Widgery himself, who had seen her coming.
“So you came down,” he said, and seemed to hesitate about
admitting her. He was a tallish, stooping man with a large
bare pock-marked face, a dropping nether lip, a large nose
that snored occasionally when he breathed, and furtive
very small brown eyes. He was clad in dark grey ill-fitting
garments, with a frayed collar and a very worn made-up
black satin tie. His waistcoat was mainly unbuttoned and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
he fidgeted with his hands. He looked at Christina Alberta
as though he found her more formidable than he had
thought her.</p>

<p>“Did you see Daddy?” said Christina Alberta, coming
straight to the point.</p>

<p>He compressed his mouth and shook his head from side
to side as though he recalled painful things.</p>

<p>“Was he bad? Was he queer or—<i>dreadful</i>?”</p>

<p>“Not too loud, my dear,” he said in his husky whispering
voice. “We don’t want <i>every one</i> to hear about your
trouble. Come in here where we can talk properly.”</p>

<p>He led the way into the little living-room in which her
father had so recently planned the conditions for the conversion
of the laundry into a limited company. The
familiar furniture had been rearranged rather amazingly,
and a large, dark bureau had been placed under the window.
With discreet gestures, Sam Widgery closed the
door and came towards her. “Sit down, Chrissie,” he said,
“and don’t get excited. I was afraid you might come
rushing down here. But of course I was bound to write
to you.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Mad as a hatter,” he said. “They say he made a riot at
the Rubicon Restaurant. Wanted to give a great banquet
there to all the beggars in London.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him? Was he well? Was he unhappy?
What have they done with him?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t <i>pelt</i> me with questions, Chrissie. You
mustn’t let your mind go on at such a pace. I told you in
my letter I went up and saw him. They called him out and
he came to me in a little room.”</p>

<p>“Where was it? Where was this workhouse?”</p>

<p>“There you go again. Just sit down and take things
quietly, my girl. I can’t answer all these questions at
once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Where was it you saw him? Was it at Gifford Street?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Where else could it be? They was waiting to remove
him.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Some asylum I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Cummerdown Hill?”</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, it <i>was</i> Cummerdown Hill. Yes—they
said Cummerdown Hill. He came out. He looked
much as usual, but more vacant perhaps, until he set eyes
on me and then he gave a sort of start and said, ‘Don’t
know you,’ he said. Like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, that wasn’t mad. Did he <i>look</i> mad? I suppose
he didn’t want to talk to you—after all the disagreeable
things that have been said.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. Any’ow I said to him, ‘What! don’t know
<i>me</i>?’ I said; ‘not know old Sam Widgery what you planted
your laundry on?’ Just like that—joking at him like.
Quite kindly but—humorous. ‘I don’t know you,’ he says
and tried to go. ‘Hold hard!’ I said and took him by the
arm. ‘You’re a base, complaining scoundrel,’ he says to
me and sort of tried to push me away. ‘You’d rewin any
laundry!’ he says—him to me, what was in the laundry
business a dozen years before he married your poor
mother. ‘Any ’ow I haven’t your complaint,’ I says, ‘Mr.
Albert Edward Preemby.’ He sort of stiffened. ‘Sargum,’
he says, ‘if you please....’”</p>

<p>“Sargon,” Christina Alberta corrected.</p>

<p>“Maybe. It sounded like ‘Sargum.’ And ‘Sargum’ he
would have it. Mad as a hatter on that. I tried to talk
but what was the good of talking? I couldn’t get anything
plain or straight out of him at all. Started threatening me
with the bastinado—whatever that may be. I asked him
to be decent with his language. ‘I’ve ’ad enough’ I says
to the attendant at last and the attendant took him away.
And so we’re quit of him, Chrissie.”</p>

<p>“Quit of him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Quit of him. What can anyone do?”</p>

<p>“Everything. Did he look very unhappy? Did he look
frightened or ill-treated?”</p>

<p>“Why should he? They’re taking proper care of him
and he’s out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure he looked—serene?”</p>

<p>“Bit jaded perhaps. That’s his own internal workings I
expect. But he’s where he ought to be, Chrissie. I feel
that. What we’ve got to do, from what Mr. Punter says, is
to let well alone. There he is with everything he wants,
living on the ratepayers’ money. We’ve got ourselves to
consider. We’ve got to think of that crazy preference-share
idea he’s saddled the laundry with. <i>That’s</i> urgent.
It’s a charge of nearly five hundred a year as things are,
nearly ten pound a week. There isn’t a laundry in London
could stand it.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to see my Daddy,” said Christina Alberta.
“I don’t believe he <i>is</i> so comfortable. I’ve heard horrid
stories of asylums. Anyhow, I ought to go right away and
see him.”</p>

<p>“Can’t do that, Chrissie,” said Mr. Widgery, shaking his
large grey face slowly from side to side and watching her
as he spoke. “They don’t have visitors running in and out
of these mad-houses just whenever they want to. Wouldn’t
<i>do</i>, you know. The poor creatures have to be kept quiet
and not excited. I daresay I could give you a letter for
next visiting day——”</p>

<p>“<i>You!</i> Give <i>me</i> a letter!”</p>

<p>Mr. Widgery shrugged his shoulders. “It would help
you to get in. But you won’t make anything of him,
Chrissie, even if you see him. And you’ll have to wait for
a visiting day. You must do that.”</p>

<p>“I want to see him.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. But regulations are regulations. Meanwhile
there’s all this business muddle we got to put straight.
While he’s in that asylum I think what I ought to do is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
give you ’n allowance, five pounds a week say, and keep
back the rest until we’re able to get something settled up.
Or four. Or perhaps as you want it—not a definite sum.
I don’t know. I haven’t thought it out yet. You can’t
possibly want to do with all that ten pounds a week with
him off your hands. Then we’ll be able to see where we
stand and everything will be all right again.”</p>

<p>He paused and scratched his cheek and watched her with
his little sidelong eyes. “See?” he said as if to stimulate
her to speech.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta looked at him in a silence that became
painful. Then she stood up and regarded him—her arms
akimbo and her face alight.</p>

<p>“I see now,” she said. “You damned old Rascal!”</p>

<p>Mr. Widgery had nice old-fashioned ideas about young
ladies and ladylike language. He was taken aback.
“Now!” he said. “<i>Now!</i>”</p>

<p>“Always I should think,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say things like that, Chrissie. You
mustn’t use words like that. You mustn’t get wrong ideas
about all this. What d’you mean? Old rascal! Something
old rascal! Why? I’m only doing what I got to do.
You aren’t really of age yet, you’re just a mere child legally
speaking, and it falls to <i>me</i> naturally, <i>me</i>, his nearest relative
so to speak, to make such arrangements as have to be
made about his affairs. That’s all. You mustn’t get wrong
ideas about it all and you mustn’t get excited. See?”</p>

<p>“I called you,” said Christina Alberta, “a damned old
Rascal.”</p>

<p>He did not meet her eye. He spoke as if he appealed to
the bureau.</p>

<p>“And does it do you any good to use such horrible expressions?
And does it do me any harm? And does it
alter the fact that whether I like it or not, I’ve got to look
after his property now and see about it and see you don’t
get into any trouble or mischief? All me and your aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
have been thinking about is just what’s right and proper
to be done for you. And then you turn on me like a serpent
and use language——!”</p>

<p>Words failed Mr. Widgery, and still seeking sympathy
from the bureau, he shrugged his shoulders and threw out
his hands.</p>

<p>“You’re no relation of his,” said Christina Alberta. “I
guessed when I read your letter that this was the sort of
thing you’d be up to. You’re glad to have him out of the
way because he was such a one for punctual payments.
You think I’m all alone; you think I’m just a girl and that
you can do what you like now with me. You’ve made a
mistake. I’ll make you pay up every penny that’s due on
the laundry and I’ll see you do it more punctually than
ever. And why didn’t you do something to get him out as
soon as you heard they’d taken him?”</p>

<p>“Now don’t you go getting excited, Chrissie,” said Mr.
Widgery. “Even if I ain’t a blood relation of his, I am of
yours. I’m your next-of-kin and your best friend and I
got to think what’s got to be done about <i>you</i>. I got to act
for <i>you</i>. In spite of bad language and everything. I tell
you he’s right and safe where he is and I’m not going to
have anything done to disturb him. Nothing at all.
There he is and there he’s going to stay, and I’m going to
act as Mr. Punter advised me to act. I’m going to keep
back his dividends as they fall due, and pay you what I
think proper to pay you for your keep and so on and charge
it to him, and I’m going to see you live an orderly sort of life
in future now too, same as my poor cousin Christina would
have wanted you to do. You’ve been knocking about the
world in a perfectly scandalous way and learning to curse
and swear. It can’t go on. That’s how things are, Chrissie,
and the sooner you see them the right way round the
better.”</p>

<p>The young woman stood speechless while Mr. Widgery
unfolded his intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Where’s Mrs. Widgery?” she said at last with an effect
of stupendous self-control.</p>

<p>“Up in the laundry seeing to things. No need to bother
her. We been talking about all this, over and over, and
we’re quite of one mind in the matter. It’s <i>our</i> right to
look after you and it’s <i>our</i> responsibility to look after you,
and we mean to do our duty by you, Chrissie, whether
you like it or not.”</p>

<p>Unpleasant doubts assailed Christina Alberta. She was
still two months short of one and twenty, and it was quite
conceivable that the law gave this ugly, oily creature all
sorts of preposterous powers of interference with her. Still
it was her style to carry off things with a brave face.</p>

<p>“All this is just nonsense,” she said. “I’m not going to
have my Daddy put away like this without a word from
me, and I’m not going to let you muddle about with his
property. Everybody in the family knows you’re a crooked
muddler. Mother used to say so. I’m going to see about
him myself, and I’m going to have him sent off to
some special sort of mental nursing place where he can
have proper attention. And that’s what I came to tell
you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Widgery’s little eyes seemed to weigh and judge her.
“You’re giving yourself high and mighty airs, Chrissie,” he
said, after a little pause. “You’ll do this and you’ll do that.
You’ve got a sort of wrong idea of what you can do in the
world. You haven’t got any money and you haven’t got
any authority, and the sooner you get that into your head
the better.”</p>

<p>That scared feeling was gaining upon Christina Alberta.
In order to counteract it she deliberately lost her temper.
“I’ll jolly soon show you what I can do and what you
can’t,” she said with a flaming face.</p>

<p>“Now don’t <i>yew</i> go getting excited,” said Mr. Widgery.
“You of all people shouldn’t get excited.”</p>

<p>“<i>Excited!</i>” said Christina Alberta; rallying for a repartee,
and then struck by an ugly thought she stopped short and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
stared at the little bright brown eyes in the pock-marked
face. Mutely they answered her mute amazed question.
This was the third or fourth time he had used the word
“excited” and now she knew what he was aiming at. Suddenly
she realized the train of ideas that her Daddy’s
extinction had set going in his head. He also had been
studying the lunacy laws—and dreaming dreams.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Mr. Widgery. “You’ve always been a
queerish sort of girl, Chrissie, and the rackety life you lead
and now this affair has been a strain on you. Must have
been. You’ve got no quiet friends but your aunt and me
and no quiet place to come to but here. Don’t you go flaring
out at me, Chrissie; I mean well by you. I’m not
going to go paying you money to keep you up there in
London. Why!—you might go gettings drugs or anything.
Call me a something rascal if you like. Swear at me as
though you were out of your senses; it won’t alter what I
mean to do. I want you to come down here and rest your
mind and nerves for a time, and let me get in some one to
see you—see what ought to be done about you....
You’ll thank me for it some day.”</p>

<p>His big grey face seemed to expand and swim about
before her eyes and the room grew small and dark.</p>

<p>“It’s my duty to see after you,” he said. “It can’t hurt
you or anyone for us to have advice.”</p>

<p>In the train from Liverpool Street she had told herself
she had intended to wipe the floor with Mr. Sam Widgery,
but things hardly seemed to be happening like that.</p>

<p>“Bah!” she cried. “D’you think I’d come back here?”</p>

<p>“Better than being lost in London, Chrissie,” he said.
“Better than being lost in London. We can’t have you
wandering off in London, same as your father did.”</p>

<p>She felt that the time had come for her to go, but for a
second or so she could not move to do so. She could not
move because she feared he might do something to detain
her, and if he did she did not know what she would do.
Then she pulled herself up by the feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“Well,” she said with a step past him doorward that
turned him on his heel; “I’ve told you what I think of you.
I’d better be getting back to London.”</p>

<p>In his eyes she saw the thought of obstructing her flash
into being and die. “Won’t you stay and have something,”
he said, “before you go back?”</p>

<p>“Eat <i>here</i>!” she cried and got to the door.</p>

<p>Her hand trembled so that it was difficult to turn the
handle. He stood motionless, staring at her with his lower
lip dropping and an expression of doubt upon his face. It
was as if he was not quite sure of himself nor of the
course he meant to pursue. The course he wanted to
pursue was appallingly plain.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>She walked with dignity out of the open front door and
down the garden path. She did not look back, but she
knew his face came up close to the window and watched
her. Never in her whole life had panic come so near to her.
She would have liked to run.</p>

<p>After the train had started she felt a little safer. “How
the devil can he get at me?” she said aloud to the empty
compartment.</p>

<p>But she wasn’t at all sure that she couldn’t be got at and
she found herself trying to estimate just how much support
and friendship she might find in her London friends.
Could she, for instance, count upon Mr. Paul Lambone?
If supplies were cut off could she get some sort of job and
keep herself for a time until she could extract her
silly Daddy from the net into which he had fallen? How
would Harold and Fay, perennially hard-up, behave if
supplies ran out? And meanwhile there was Daddy,
wondering why no help came to him—puzzled by what
had happened to him and no doubt getting sillier and
sillier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Christina Alberta was growing up fast now. Beneath all
her radicalism and rebellion there had always hitherto
been a belief, tacit, sub-conscious, in the rightness and
security and sustaining energy of the social framework.
There is under most youthful rebellion. She had assumed
without thinking very much about it that hospitals were
places of comfort and luxury, doctors in full possession
and use of all existing science, prisons clean and exemplary
places, that though laws might still be unjust that the
administration of the law was untouched by knavery or
weakness. She had had the same confidence in the ultimate
integrity of social life that a little child has in the
invincible safeness of nursery and home. But now she was
awakening to the fact that the whole world was insecure.
It was not that it was a wicked or malignant world, but that
it was an inattentive and casual world. It dreaded bothers.
It would do the meanest, most dangerous, and cruellest
things to escape the pressure of bothers, and it would
refuse to be bothered by any sufferings or evil it could
possibly contrive to ignore. It was a dangerous world, a
world of bothered people in which one might be lost and
forgotten while one was still alive and suffering. It was a
world in which it is not good to be alone, and she was
beginning to feel herself very dangerously alone.</p>

<p>She had never, she reflected, thought very much of her
family, but now she perceived a family may dissolve away
too soon. She wanted a wall to put her back against if
after all Sam Widgery screwed up his courage to be aggressive;
she wanted some one who would be her very own,
a safe ally, some one she could count upon, some one closer
than law or custom, some one who would go about and
find out exactly what had happened to her if she fell into
disaster, who would refuse to accept her downfall, some
one who would care for her more than he cared for himself
and not be lightly turned away.</p>

<p><i>Himself?</i> Not <i>herself</i>. In fact, a lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Damn Teddy!” cried Christina Alberta, and knocked a
puff of dust out of the railway cushion with her fist. “He
messes it up.</p>

<p>“And I knew what he was. I knew all the time exactly
what he was!</p>

<p>“I’ve got to stick it alone,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“And besides who’d have cared for me, anyhow, with a
nose like mine?”</p>

<p>“Even if there were such things in the world as lovers
who loved like that! But it’s a world of people who don’t
care. It’s a world of people who haven’t the guts to care.
It’s a dust-heap of a world,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Her thoughts began to flow into a new region. After all,
wasn’t there something too disagreeably justifiable in the
suggestion that she was—how to put it—<i>queer</i>? Hitherto
Christina Alberta had always regarded herself as a model
of sanity and mental directness—with no fault indeed
except possibly her nose. Now the word “queer” stuck in
her mind like a thorn that has gone right home. She
could not get it out again.</p>

<p>She had always, she knew, been different. She had
always had a style of her own.</p>

<p>Most of the people she had met in the world had impressed
her as being colourless, weak in speech and action,
evasive—that was the word, “evasive.” They evaded the
use of all sorts of blunt words, they didn’t know why.
Christina Alberta was all for saying “Damn” and “guts”
and so forth until some one convinced her of some better
reason for avoiding them than merely that they weren’t
used by “nice” people. These others were always not saying
things because they weren’t said and not doing things
because they weren’t done. And for what was said and
what was done, however manifestly preposterous it was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
they had a sort of terrified imitativeness. They just ran
about being as far as possible somebody else until they
died. Why exist at all then? Why not get out of it and
leave some one else in possession? But, anyhow, they got
through life. They didn’t get into trouble. They supported
one another. And, on the other hand, if you didn’t
evade? You puzzled other people. You left the track.
You were like a train leaving the rails and trying to take
a cross-country short-cut. You hit against—everything.</p>

<p>Was this evasive life she had always despised really the
sane life? Was ceasing to evade ceasing to be sane?
Sheep, she had read, had a disease called gid; then they
wandered alone and died. Was all this originality and
thinking for oneself and not going with the crowd and so
forth, that had been her pride and glory, just the way out
from the sane life? Originality, eccentricity, queerness,
craziness, madness; was that merely a quantitative scale?</p>

<p>Was not her Daddy’s queerness this, that after years of
the extremest evasion he had at last tried to break away
to something real and strange? And had she, after her
fashion, been attempting anything else? Was she, too, lop-sided?
Lop-sided in a different direction, perhaps, but lop-sided
none the less. An inherited lop-sidedness?</p>

<p>Her mind went off at a tangent on the question whether
she had really inherited anything whatever from her
Daddy. Was his queerness her sort of queerness at all? It
ought to be, seeing that they were father and daughter.</p>

<p>How different they were! For a father and daughter how
amazingly different they were!...</p>

<p>But were they father and daughter? A much repressed
fantasy came back to her—a fantasy based on the flimsiest
foundations, on chance phrases her mother had used, on
moments of intuition. Once or twice a reverie had arisen
out of these lurking particles of memory and had taken her
by surprise only to be thrust aside again with contempt.</p>

<p>Blup. Blup. Blup. There came a familiar variation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
the familiar sounds of the train. Christina Alberta was
running into Liverpool Street Station and her perplexities
were all unsolved.</p>

<p>The old fantasy lost heart and faded away. What was
the good of such dreams? There she was.</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>Christina Alberta’s meeting next day with Wilfred
Devizes turned out to be a much more exciting affair than
she or he had expected it to be.</p>

<p>Acting on the advice of Paul Lambone, she had brought
photographs and a letter or so in her Daddy’s handwriting
with her, and she had thought out what she judged would
be significant things to tell about him. She went in a taxi
with Paul Lambone to Devizes’ house just off Cavendish
Square, and they were shown up at once past a waiting-room
and a consulting-room to a dignified little sitting-room
with an open fire and a table with tea-things and a
great array of bookcases. Devizes came in to them
forthwith.</p>

<p>She was a little shocked to think that this lank, dark,
shock-headed man could be recognizably like her. He was
younger than she had expected him to be, younger she
thought, than her Daddy or Mr. Lambone, and he wore a
long unbuttoned morning coat. He carried the nose all
right; he was indeed very good-looking.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Paul,” he said cheerfully. “Is this the young
lady whose father’s been stolen? We’ll have some tea. It’s
Miss——?”</p>

<p>“Miss Preemby,” said Paul Lambone, “but every one
calls her Christina Alberta.”</p>

<p>Devizes turned an eye that was by habit and disposition
a scrutinizing eye upon her. He betrayed a faint momentary
surprise and came and shook hands. “Tell me
all about it,” he said. “You don’t think he’s really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
mad, but only rather exceptional and odd. That’s it,
isn’t it? Lambone tells me he is sane. It’s quite possible.
I’d better go over the state of his mind first, and then we
can discuss the question of the asylum afterwards. I
gather you want to get him under your own care—outside.
That isn’t by any means simple. We’ll have to study the
obstacles. Meanwhile tea.... I’ve been disentangling
the delusions of a perfectly terrible old lady, and I’m
rather deflated. Just tell me all about it in your own
way.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Paul, settling his shoulders into his
arm-chair, and preparing to interrupt.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta began to unfold her premeditated discourse.
Every now and then Devizes would interrupt her
with a question. He kept his eyes on her, and it seemed to
her even from the beginning that they betrayed something
more than attention to what she was saying. He looked at
her as though he had seen her before and couldn’t quite
remember where. She described her Daddy’s talks to her
when she was a girl, about the Pyramids and the Lost
Atlantis and so forth, and the odd spirit of release and
renewed growth that had followed the death of her mother.
She told of the spiritualistic séance and the coming of
Sargon. Devizes was very keen on various aspects of
the Sargon story. “It was odd that the suggestion fell in
so aptly with Preemby’s mental disposition. What was
that young man up to? I don’t quite understand him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think he just hit by chance on the
stuff he talked. It was just bad luck that it fitted.”</p>

<p>“Undergraduate idea of fun?”</p>

<p>“Undergraduate fun. It might have been Tut-an-ka-man.”</p>

<p>“But it happened to be Sargon.”</p>

<p>“He may have been reading some ancient history.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t, I suppose, know anything about your
father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Couldn’t have done. I suppose he thought my—my
Daddy looked a little small and absurd, and I suppose it
appealed to his sense of humour to single him out from the
others and make him a great king. I’d like to have a few
minutes straight talk with that young man.”</p>

<p>“This you see isn’t a delusion, Devizes. It’s a deception,”
said Paul Lambone.</p>

<p>“Is he generally coherent,” asked Devizes.</p>

<p>“Granted his thesis, he’s amazingly coherent,” she said.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t sometimes become some one else, God or a
millionaire, or anything of that sort?”</p>

<p>“No. He believes in reincarnation and hints at having
lived other lives, but that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Thousands of people do that,” said Lambone.</p>

<p>“And nobody is persecuting him? Nobody makes noises
to trouble him or gets at him with X-rays or anything of
that sort?”</p>

<p>“Not a shadow of that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“The man’s sane. Unless he went mad when he walked
out of your friends’ studio.”</p>

<p>“I’m for his sanity right out,” said Lambone. “I wish I’d
had a chance to talk to him. There’s something—everybody’s
chattering now about an Inferiority Complex.
Well, isn’t it common for people who have been rather put
upon and deceived and so forth, and who don’t want to
face the facts of life, to take refuge in an assumed personality?
And putting the reveries, the spiritualist séance and
so forth all together, doesn’t it work out on those lines?”</p>

<p>“He knows he is really, <i>au fond</i>, Preemby?” Devizes
asked.</p>

<p>“It annoyed him to tell him so,” said Christina Alberta.
“I think one reason why he went away was because I and
my friend, Mrs. Crumb that is, at the studio where we live,
would try to make him be sensible about that. It drove
him away. He knows he is really Preemby and he hates it.
He knows this is all a make-believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>Paul Lambone took up the discourse. “I do so sympathize
with that. So far from that being insane it’s perfectly
rational. Becoming somebody else greater than oneself is
part of half the religions of the world. All the Mithraists
used to become Mithra. The Serapists, if I remember
rightly, used to become Osiris. We all want to be born
again really. Every one with any sense and humility does.
Into something greater. ‘Who will deliver me from the
body of this death?’ That’s why Christina Alberta’s
Daddy is so tremendously interesting. He’s got imagination;
he’s got originality. He may be a feeble little chap,
but he has that.”</p>

<p>“Having an exceptional mind isn’t insanity,” said
Devizes, “or else we should put all our poets and artists
in asylums.”</p>

<p>“Few would come up to that standard,” said Lambone.
“I wish they did.”</p>

<p>Devizes reflected. “I think I’ve got things clear. He’s
coherent. He’s neat in his dress. He isn’t persecuted.
He’s unselfish in his thoughts, almost romantically so. And
he’s not fattish and lumpish, and he’s never had any sort of
fit. There’s no insane type a properly qualified doctor
could class him under, but then most doctors are altogether
unqualified for mental practice. A stupid doctor might
mistake his imaginations for the splendour of paranoia or
take his abstraction in reverie for <i>dementia præcox</i> or think
he was a masked epileptic. But all these are cases of
mental disease, and your father is probably not diseased at
all. He’s mentally disturbed, but that’s all. The difference
between him and a real lunatic is the difference between a
basketful of fruit that’s been overturned, and a basketful
that’s gone rotten. Overturned fruit gets bruised and rots
very easily—but being overturned isn’t being rotten. What
sort of man is he to look at?”</p>

<p>“She’s got photographs,” said Lambone.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see them,” he said, and was given a recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
one of Mr. Preemby as laundryman. “Too much moustache
by a long way,” he said. “Is there anything—with
some at least of his face uncovered? There’s nothing here
but his eyes.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d feel that,” said Lambone. “There’s one
of Mr. Preemby as a young man, taken soon after his wedding
with Mrs. Preemby. Have you got it, Christina
Alberta?... Here we are.... That’s Mrs. Preemby in
the chair. The moustache—in bulk—has yet to come.”</p>

<p>“He married young?” Devizes asked Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“He must have done,” she said. “I don’t know his exact
age. My mother never told me.”</p>

<p>Devizes scrutinized the photograph. “Queer,” he said,
and seemed to be searching his memory. “Something
familiar. I’ve met people like this.</p>

<p>“They were both London people, I suppose,” he said,
looking hard at Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Woodford Wells,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“My father was born at Sheringham,” she added as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>“Sheringham. That’s queer.” With a manifestly deepened
interest he looked at the couple posed against one of
those rustic backgrounds dear to Victorian photographers.
“Chrissy,” he repeated to himself. “Chrissy. Christina
Alberta. It <i>can’t</i> be.”</p>

<p>For some moments Dr. Devizes ceased to attend to his
consultants and they remained intently observing him.
He tried to fix his attention on the young man’s face in the
picture, but it was the young woman who sat on the rustic
style that absorbed his interest. Amazing how completely
he had forgotten her face, and how she came back now
incredibly unlike and yet like his memory of her. He
remembered the glasses and the neck and shoulders. And
a sort of stiff defiance. “When were your mother and father
married?” he asked. “How long ago?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen ninety-nine,” she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“And then you were born straight away?” He asked
the question with an affectation of ease.</p>

<p>“There was a decent interval,” said Christina Alberta
with a clumsy levity. “I was born in nineteen hundred.”</p>

<p>“A little, fair, blue-eyed chap with rather an absent-minded
manner. I seem to see him,” Devizes said, and
resumed his examination of the photograph. Nobody
spoke for the better part of a minute. “Good Lord!”
whispered Lambone to himself. Devizes drank a cup of
tea absent-mindedly. “Extraordinary,” he ejaculated. “I
never dreamt of it.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>His answer went off at a tangent. “Christina Alberta’s
resemblance to my mother. It’s amazing. It’s been worrying
me ever since I came into the room. It’s been distracting
my attention. I’ve got a little picture....”</p>

<p>He jumped up and went out of the room. Christina
Alberta, puzzled, excited, turned instantly on Lambone.
“He knew my father and mother,” she said.</p>

<p>“Apparently,” said Lambone with something defensive in
his voice.</p>

<p>“<i>Apparently!</i>” she echoed. “But—he <i>knew</i> them! He
<i>knew</i> them well. And—<i>What’s he thinking of?</i>”</p>

<p>Devizes reappeared holding out a small gold-framed picture.
“Look at that!” he said and handed it to Paul Lambone.
“It might be Christina Alberta. Don’t you see how
like it is? Allowing for that preposterous hair piled upon
her head and the way her dress goes up round her neck.”</p>

<p>He handed the picture to Christina Alberta and looked
at Lambone in amazed interrogation.</p>

<p>“It might be me in fancy dress,” Christina Alberta
agreed, with the picture in her hands. There came a long
pause. She looked up and saw the expression of his face.
Her mind gave a fantastic leap, so fantastic that it instantly
leapt back to the point of departure. It was like a flash
of lightning in a night as dark as pitch. She made a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
effort to pull the conversation together, to behave as though
her mind had never leapt at all. “But what has all this
to do with my Daddy’s case?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing directly. Your resemblance to my mother is a
pure coincidence. Pure. But it’s a curious coincidence!
Just for the moment it pulled my attention aside. Forgive
me. I’ve a belief that where there’s resemblance of this
sort there’s a blood relationship. I suppose your mother’s
people—what did you say they were called—Hoskin?”</p>

<p>“Did I say? I don’t remember. I <i>didn’t</i> say. I didn’t.
Her name was Hossett.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!—Hossett. I suppose that two or three generations
back the Hossetts and Devizes intermarried. And
there we are! Cousins—at we don’t know what remove.
But types go under in a family and then bob up again. It
sort of links us, Christina Alberta, doesn’t it? It gives me
a special interest. I don’t feel now that you’re just any old
patient. Or, rather, just Paul’s friend. I feel linked. Well—That’s
that. Let’s come back to your father. Who
married your mother just when they were starting the
old South African war. He’s always been a dreamy, unobservant
type. As we were saying. Even from the
beginning....”</p>

<p>He stopped short.</p>

<p>“Always,” said Christina Alberta, after a long pause.</p>

<p>“We’ve been into all that,” said Devizes and paused, and
was for a minute entirely at a loss for words. “Yes,” he
said at last.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating fast and there was a flush of
excitement on her cheeks. Her quick wits had filled in all
the gaps. She understood now—and then again it vanished.
She would have liked to have gone away and
thought it all over at once. But that wouldn’t do. She
must disregard the questions that surged up within her.
Her mind went forward like an obstinate traveller caught
in a whirlwind. Her mother for example. She was trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
to recall something about her mother that had long been
stifled in her mind. “Went away and left me to it,” was it?
“Went off and left me to it?” Her mother lying in bed and
wandering. Who had left her to what? That standing
perplexity. That suspicion. That dream. But attend to
him now, Christina Alberta; attend to him! She was
observing him with all her being, and yet she seemed deaf
to what he said.</p>

<p>He was saying that now that he agreed with them that
Preemby was sane, he could see his way to the real business
before them. It was the old, old story of making lunatics
out of sane people which they encountered in Preemby’s
case. It was the old, old story of making lunatics out of
sane people which they encountered in Preemby’s case.
(He repeated his sentence word for word without apparently
realizing he had said it twice.) All exceptional people
were in danger of being misunderstood, but such a type as
Preemby, original and yet incapable of abstract expression
or philosophical method, which sought fantastic expression
for its feelings and impulses, was particularly liable
to give offence, awaken suspicion and dread and hostility.
It was just these borderland cases he was always trying to
save from asylums, and just such cases that were always
going there. And they were the last people to bring into
contact with real insanity. “To go back to my metaphor,
the basketful of fruit isn’t rotten, is scarcely speckled with
decay, but it is disordered and overturned. A mind is a
delicate thing to knock about. It will rot very easily, and
a mind like your father’s particularly will rot very easily
under asylum conditions. After all this rigmarole I come
to just the conclusion you’ve already reached, that we have
to get Preemby out of Cummerdown Hill and away under
restful conditions as soon as possible. When we’ll comb
out his particular complex and get him into working relations
with the world again. I’m quite sure we can do that
somehow, make his incognito permanent, make him an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Emperor in exile, restore his proper name, organize a
common daily round for him and get him back more and
more to be a chastened and released Preemby.”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Lambone, roused from a profound
contemplation of the two interesting faces before him.</p>

<p>“It isn’t easy. Even to get at him isn’t easy. There will
be delays. A careless magistrate and a silly doctor can
make a lunatic in five minutes. It takes no end of time
to unmake one.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to set about doing,” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Devizes, “and I’m with you.”</p>

<p>He explained one or two points in lunacy law, began
sketching a scheme of operations, considered the people
to whom she ought to write and the people to whom he
ought to write, and how soon it would be possible to see
Preemby, and give him a word of encouragement. Already
Devizes had had several brushes with lunacy organization;
he was considered a troublesome but dangerous man for a
medical superintendent to be up against. That might
arouse either hostile obstruction or the propitiatory spirit.
They must go carefully.</p>

<p>Lambone scarcely interrupted now at all. He had ceased
to be acutely interested in Preemby, immured away there
in Cummerdown. He was lost in admiration of the self-control
his astonishing friends displayed. He tried to
imagine what an undertow of strange excitement, of queer
thoughts and confused emotions there must be beneath
their highly intelligent discussion of the case of Mr.
Preemby. They wasted very little attention upon the onlooker.
Christina Alberta’s face was faintly flushed, and
her eyes glowed; Devizes was rather less of a conversationalist
than usual and rather more like a university tutor
with an exceptionally interesting student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>The subject was exhausted at last and the time came to
depart. Devizes came to the door with them.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that I’m always round the corner, so to speak,”
he said. “I’m in the telephone directory. And
don’t forget, Christina Alberta, don’t forget I’m your long-lost
cousin, very much at your service.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget that,” said Christina Alberta, meeting
his eye.</p>

<p>A little pause, and then rather stiffly they shook hands.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>“Am I mad?” said Christina Alberta as soon as she and
Paul Lambone were in the street together. “Am I
dreaming?”</p>

<p>Lambone was clumsy. “Mad? Dreaming? How?”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t pretend not to understand. That he’s my
real father? Don’t pretend! or, please don’t pretend! Is
he or is he not?”</p>

<p>Lambone did not reply for a moment. “You flash at
things—like a lizard. How could it have happened?”</p>

<p>“Then you <i>did</i> think?”</p>

<p>“My dear Christina Alberta, he didn’t know you existed
until he set eyes on you. I’m sure of that.”</p>

<p>“But then. Wasn’t it plain? He <i>knew them both</i>!”</p>

<p>“Devizes,” said Lambone, “is ten years younger than I
am. He’s barely forty. He must have been—not more
than eighteen. Nineteen at most. It’s a little difficult.”</p>

<p>“That makes it easier. You never knew mother. If they
were both young——”</p>

<p>“It’s just possible,” said Lambone, “there is some other
explanation.”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Can’t imagine. I suppose he was at Sheringham—perhaps
for a holiday—and met her. But——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“It must have been something casual, a kind of accident.
Mother used to have flashes.... I never quite understood
her. She used to suppress me, and perhaps she was
suppressing herself.... And at the end—she said something.
Someone had left her to it.... Do you know—at
times—I’ve had fancies—suspicions! It seemed as though
she guessed that I was guessing. Now I know—I <i>was</i>.
It’s incredible. And yet it explains a hundred things.”</p>

<p>“He certainly never knew of you. He’s—amazed.”</p>

<p>“And what’s going to happen next?”</p>

<p>“Legally you’re Preemby’s daughter. Nothing can alter
that. All the resemblances and coincidences in the world
won’t alter that.”</p>

<p>“And all the law in the world won’t alter the facts.
And——”</p>

<p>She turned on Lambone with a flushed face. “Do you
realize what it means to think you are the daughter of a
certified lunatic? And then find you are not? All last
night I was awake with that unendurable thought.”</p>

<p>“All night—at your age!”</p>

<p>“It seemed all night. Last night—I <i>tried</i> to imagine that
something of this sort had happened. Tried—and couldn’t.
Tried to bring back all those old fancies. And here it is!
I might have known. I did know and wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>“Tell me about this real father of mine. I don’t know
a thing about him. Is he a good man? Is he a bad man?
Has he a wife?”</p>

<p>“He adored his wife. And so did I. She was one of the
loveliest and cleverest young women I’ve ever known. She
was strong and jolly—and the beastly influenza and pneumonia
got her. In a week. It cut him to ribbons. They’d
had no children. They’d had only four years together.
He’s attractive to women, but I don’t think there’ll be a
second Mrs. Devizes for a long time. I can’t imagine
it. Any other woman! Why! All that house—it’s full of
her presence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Yes,” said Christina Alberta, and thought for a time.</p>

<p>They were detached for a time in crossing Bond Street,
and the pavement was too crowded and Piccadilly was too
congested for them to talk again until they went in St.
James’ Street.</p>

<p>“Daddy,” said Christina Alberta, “seems ten thousand
miles away. But when I’m over the amazement of this I
expect I’ll get back to him all right. But just for a time—he
must wait.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come in for a bit?” said Lambone at the corner
of Half Moon Street. “I could give you some dinner.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’ll walk all the way to Chelsea,” said
Christina Alberta. “I want to think this out by myself.
I want to get alone with this spinning head of mine and
try to slow it down. My life’s gone topsy-turvy. Or it’s
been topsy-turvy and it’s suddenly come right side up. I
don’t know which. Oh!—I don’t know anything. I’ve
got to begin all over again.”</p>

<p>She shook hands and paused. Lambone waited, for
manifestly she had something to say. She got it out at last.</p>

<p>“Do you think—he liked me?”</p>

<p>“He liked you all right, Christina Alberta. Don’t you
worry about that.”</p>

<h4>§ 8</h4>

<p>It was a little more than two days before Christina
Alberta, to use her own expression, “got back” to her lost
Daddy.</p>

<p>Those two days were full of an immense excitement.
Devizes was the most wonderful fact in the world. She
exploded into love for him. She had the most vivid impression
of him, dark and tall, rather grave, watchful and
amazingly understandable. Yet vivid as her impression
was she doubted every detail of it, and wanted to go back
to him and verify it all over again. It was their quality of
mutual understanding that was at once the most delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
and the most incredible aspect of the whole affair. Their
brains no doubt were unlike, as every two individual
brains must be, yet their unlikeness was not a mere accumulation
of accidental difference, but the unlikeness of
two variations of one theme. She could feel his intentions
beneath his words. Her mind had jumped with his realizations
and there must be kinks and turns in her brain, kinks
and turns that just made her difficult and queer for most
people, which would find the completest parallels in his.
She didn’t believe there was a thing in her thoughts and
acts that she would be surprised at his knowing and
comprehending.</p>

<p>She had never before thought of parentage with any
enthusiasm. She had viewed it rather in the spirit of
Samuel Butler and Bernard Shaw, and conceived of parents
generally in relation to their children as embarrassed hypocrites
with an instinctive disposition towards restraint
and suppression. She had made an exception of her own
particular pair; Daddy had been a great friend anyhow,
though mother for the most part had been a concentrated
incarnate “Don’t.” But she had never realized there might
be something rather intimately interesting in consanguinity.
And then suddenly a door had opened, a man had
come in and sat down and talked to her and discovered
himself the nearest thing in life to her. And she to him.
She wanted to go to him again; she wanted to see more of
him, be with him. But he made no sign and she could
think of no decent excuse for a call upon him. The very
intensity of her desire made her unable to go to him easily.
She wrote the various letters they had agreed she should
write, and then decided to master mental science and
lunacy generally. That and the case of her “Daddy” she
perceived to be her formal link with Devizes.</p>

<p>She set out for the Reading Room of the British Museum,
for which she had a students’ ticket, and she tried to concentrate
her mind upon the book she had requisitioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
instead of letting it wander off into the strangest reveries
about this miraculously discovered blood relation. In the
afternoon she rang up Lambone to be given tea, with the
intention of learning everything that the wise man could
tell her about Devizes and generally turning him over conversationally.
But Lambone was out. The next day the
craving for Devizes was overpowering. She rang him up.</p>

<p>“May I have some tea?” she asked. “I’ve got nothing
much to say, but I want to see you.”</p>

<p>“Delighted,” said Devizes.</p>

<p>When she got to him she found herself shy, and him as
shy as herself. For a little while they made polite conversation;
it might almost have been the conversation of
two people at a formal call in a country town. He called
her “Christina Alberta,” but she called him “Doctor
Devizes,” and he asked her if she played or danced, and
whether she had ever been abroad. She sat in an arm-chair
and he stood over her on the hearthrug. It was clear
that the only way to intimacy lay in a frank treatment
of her Daddy. She felt that if this sort of talk went on
for another minute she would have to scream or throw
her tea-cup in the fire. So she plunged.</p>

<p>“When did you first know my mother?”</p>

<p>Devizes’ attitude stiffened, and he smiled faintly at her
boldness. “I was a Cambridge undergraduate reading for
the Natural Science Tripos, and I went down to Sheringham
to read. We—we picked each other up on the beach.
We made love—in a scared, furtive, desperate, ignorant
sort of way. People were primitive in those days—compared
with what they are now.”</p>

<p>“Daddy wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“He came in afterwards.”</p>

<p>Devizes considered for a moment. He decided that it
wasn’t fair to oblige her to go on questioning him. “My
father,” he said, “was a pretty considerable old bully. He
was Sir George Devizes, the man who invented the Devizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
biscuit and cured old Alphonso, and he was celebrated for
being rude to his patients. He would smack their stomachs
and tell them they ought to be scooped out. He helped
make Unter Magenbad. He suspected me of being a bit
of a soft, though as a matter of fact I wasn’t, and he generally
had the effect of laying up for a quarrel with me. He
kept me pretty short. He wasn’t particularly nice to my
mother. He used to get at my mother through me. I
didn’t dare to have a scrape of any sort. I was really
afraid of him. If I saw a scrape blowing up my habit and
disposition was to run away.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Devizes considered the implications of that “I see.”
“Not that I ran away from any definite scrape that I knew
of at Sheringham,” he said very carefully.</p>

<p>“What was my mother like in those days?”</p>

<p>“A sort of subdued fierceness. A flushed warm face.
She was pretty, you know, and very upright in her carriage.
And she had a swift decision beneath her stiffness.
Her wishes would suddenly crystallize out, and after that
there was no bending her.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you do.”</p>

<p>“She wore glasses then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Was she fresh then? Was she happy?”</p>

<p>“A little too fierce to be happy.”</p>

<p>“Did you—ever—love her?”</p>

<p>“It is a long time ago, Christina Alberta. There was—seaside
love-making. Why do you cross-examine me like
this?”</p>

<p>“I want to know. Why”—Christina Alberta had a
momentary terror at her own boldness—“Why didn’t you
marry her?”</p>

<p>Devizes made no pretence of surprise at the question.
“There was no reason manifest why I should have married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
her. None at all. I can’t conceive what my father would
have done if I had come back from Sheringham engaged
to a chance acquaintance. And anyhow, why should I
have done anything of the sort?”</p>

<p>His eyes defied hers.</p>

<p>“I left her my address,” he added. “She could have
written to me. She never did.”</p>

<p>“Did a letter go astray?” said Christina Alberta, and
added hastily, “my imagination is running away with me.”</p>

<p>She hesitated and trembled at the next words she had
resolved to say, but she said them, with a forced offhandedness.
“You see—I might have fancied you as a
father?”</p>

<p>It produced no catastrophe. He looked her in the face
and then smiled. After that smile she felt that they understood
each other completely, and it was very pleasant to
think that. “Instead of which, you have to adopt me as a
cousin,” he said deliberately. “Cousins it is, Christina
Alberta. It’s the best we can do. We have to put our
heads together and think of your Daddy. He’s our common
concern. I’m interested in that little man. He’s
defended himself against many things by those dreams of
his. Very wilful dreams they may have been. Who
knows? Necessary protective dreams.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta did not speak for a little time. She
nodded. She was glad at their manifest understanding and
yet she was disappointed, though she could not have told
herself what else she had expected. This man a yard away
was the nearest thing in the world to her, and always there
might be this invisible barrier between them. They were
linked by an invisible tie and they were separated by an
unfathomable necessity. Never before in her life had she
known what love could be; she wanted to be free to love
him; she wanted him to love her.</p>

<p>She realized that she was standing quite still, and that
Devizes was standing just as still upon his hearthrug,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
watching her face. His mouth and eyes were quiet and
serene, but she imagined he must be gripping his hands
together behind him. She had to obey him. There was
nothing for her to do but follow his lead.</p>

<p>“Daddy’s our common concern,” she said. “I suppose I
shall begin to hear from some of those people to-morrow.”</p>

<h4>§ 9</h4>

<p>Christina Alberta got back to her Daddy in a dream.</p>

<p>It was a queer dream. She was going about the world
with Devizes and they were locked together in such a way
that she and he could never look at each other, but were
always side by side. But also with the sublime incoherence
of dreams they were at the same time great ebony images,
and they sat stiffly side by side like a Pharaoh and his
consort, and they looked over a great space; they were
very big effigies indeed and their profiles were alike. All
through the dream she thought of Devizes and herself as
black. The space before them was sometimes a sandy
desert and sometimes a grey cloudy expanse. Then suddenly
something round and white came bounding into the
midst of this arena and became a little man, a familiar little
blue-eyed man, tied up into a ball with ropes and sorely
maimed, who rolled about and panted and struggled to be
free. Oh! but he struggled pitifully. Christina Alberta’s
heart went out to him, and yet impelled by some tremendous
force within her she rose and Devizes rose beside her
and they marched stiffly forward. She could not help
herself, she could not control the rigid movements of her
hands and feet. They stepped high and forcibly. She
was voiceless, she tried to cry out, “We shall trample upon
him! We shall trample upon him!” but there was no
more than a hoarse inarticulate sound of horror in her
throat....</p>

<p>They were upon him. She felt the body of her Daddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
writhe under her. He was like a bladder. His soft, ineffectual
body, with her feet upon him, bent and bulged
about. She forgot there was anything else but her Daddy
and herself. Why had she treated him like this? Devizes
disappeared. Her Daddy was clinging to her knees and
now a crowd of vile figures had appeared and sought
to drag him away. “Save me, Christina Alberta,” he was
pleading, though she heard no sound. “Save me. Save
me! Every day they torture me.” But they dragged him
away and she could not put out her arms to him. Because
she was made of ebony and all of one piece with Devizes.</p>

<p>Then some one, a bird or a Sphinx with the face and
voice of Lambone, came into the dream. “Listen to your
Daddy,” he said. “Do not despise him or simply pity him.
He has much to teach you. The world will never learn
anything until it will learn from ridiculous people. All
people are ridiculous. I am. I am ridiculous. We learn
in suffering what we teach in song.” She saw that her
Daddy was now sheltering between the paws of the Sphinx,
and that the evil men had vanished.</p>

<p>She became intensely aware of a revealing absurdity in
her dream. No previous incompatibility had shocked her
at all, and she had never thought that she was dreaming
up to this point. But now she became intensely oppressed
by the idea that the Sphinx was an ancient Egyptian
and classical figure, and that Sargon was a still more
ancient Sumerian. The dream was going wrong. The
periods, the cultures, were mixed. She conveyed this to
Sphinx-Lambone, and he turned his head to answer her,
and immediately the evil figures were back, and taking
advantage of Lambone’s inattention, were dragging her
Daddy away. She tried to call Lambone’s attention to
that, but he said there would be plenty of time to recover
her Daddy when the point about the Sphinx was settled.
He wasn’t a Sphinx, he explained, but a Winged Bull. He
never had been a Sphinx. Or why should he be wearing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
long curly stone beard? She wanted to argue that it was a
false beard and that he had only just put it on. And anyhow
it was just like him to start an inopportune discussion.
Meanwhile her Daddy was receding into wretchedness.
She became aware of this rapidly and painfully. It was
her Daddy still, but his body was different; it was not a
human body any more, but a basket of fruit overturned.
Unless she did something at once it would go rotten and
be bad for ever.</p>

<p>She tried to cry out words of comfort and reassurance
to the poor tragic little figure before the dream came to an
end—for now she knew surely that it was a dream. Of
course he was suffering intolerably. Why had she not
written to him or telegraphed to him? Surely they would
give him a letter or a telegram! A profound self-detestation
for her incompetence and negligence, and a
great horror of pain and cruelty came upon her, and she
awoke completely to black night and infinite dismay in her
little hard bed in her stuffy little bedroom in Lonsdale
Mews.</p>

<h4>§ 10</h4>

<p>But the impression of her Daddy, desolate and broken-hearted
and in danger, remained with her, terribly vivid.
It clung to her. She got up in the morning anxious and
depressed by it.</p>

<p>“I am not doing enough for him,” she said. “I am letting
days slip by—and for him they must be days of
despair.”</p>

<p>“Sure th’ ’Sylums ’nt so ba-s-at,” said Fay. “Sure yr
overrating it.”</p>

<p>“But to live among lunatics and be classed as a lunatic!”</p>

<p>“They’ve <i>bans</i> play-them. Foxhill ’Sylum there’s <i>buful</i>
ban. ’Ntainments nors-sorts treats,” said Fay.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta refrained from bad language.</p>

<p>“You getting ill ove’ all this,” said Fay. “You doing no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
good ’n Lun. Youffar be’r come dow’ Shore’m. The’s
th’ouse spoilin’. In this las’ bit of fine w’r.”</p>

<p>For the October weather was holding out that year quite
wonderfully, a succession of calm golden days, and the
Crumbs had been offered the loan of a bungalow on the
beach at Shoreham by a friend who had used it throughout
the summer. They wanted to go down to it before the
weather broke, but going down to it meant leaving Christina
Alberta all alone in the studio, and they did not want
to do that. But they meant to go to Shoreham. Christina
Alberta, now that she had discovered Devizes, could not
endure the thought of getting out of telephone range of
him. London, she argued, was manifestly her proper
centre. She could get down to Cummerdown Hill in an
hour; she could keep in touch with everything. The
Crumbs might go but she <i>must</i> stay.</p>

<p>Fay would not understand. She pestered.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock Christina Alberta went to the Post
Office telephone booth and rang up Devizes.</p>

<p>“Can’t something be done to hurry things up?” she
asked. “I’ve got Daddy on my nerves. I can’t bear to
think of him there day after day. I’ve been dreaming
of him.”</p>

<p>“Worrying is no good. We—I’ve got some bad news for
you. So put all your controls on.”</p>

<p>He paused. Christina Alberta, for all her love of
Devizes, had to restrain her violent desire to snap, “Oh!
what is it?”</p>

<p>“Visiting day was yesterday. He had one visitor. I suppose
that’s the agreeable relation you described—what
was his name? Wiggles? Mr. Widgery. But your Daddy
can’t be seen again by the outer world for a week. Not
until next Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn!” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Exactly. I’ll do what I can to arrange some sort of
special access. I got on to the Medical Superintendent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
himself. But he’s queer. He’s evidently quite friendly and
well disposed, but he fences about. He can’t say either
Yes or No. Odd! I’m free to-day in the afternoon, but
I’m tied up to-morrow. I was for going down to see <i>him</i>—the
superintendent I mean, for a talk after lunch. ‘Better in a
day or so,’ he says. Hope there’s nothing wrong that he’s
keeping back. Afterwards he promised me to ring me up
later, and then abruptly he switched off. So hold yourself
ready, there. What’s your telephone number?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got one. You must telegraph.”</p>

<p>“Or I’ll chase round in a taxi and pick you up. Sorry to
hold you up like this, Christina Alberta.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind anything so long as it’s getting towards
Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” and the voice was cut off.</p>

<p>The telegram came after an interval of two hours, two
hours which had been devoted to a rambling dispute with
Fay about the Shoreham difficulty. The message ran as
follows: “<i>Has your father turned up he escaped at dawn
this morning in slippers and dressing-gown and nothing
seen of him since if not appeared meet me Victoria two-seven
for Cummerdown telephone Gerrard 0247 if there.</i>”</p>

<h4>§ 11</h4>

<p>But Mr. Preemby did not turn up anywhere. He just
vanished.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta, in a state of incredulous astonishment
at this fresh disappearance, went down with Devizes
to Cummerdown. They found a Medical Superintendent
by no means so amazed as they were. Sargon had been
missing at breakfast time; everything seemed to point
to his just walking out of the Asylum. That sort of thing
had happened before. It showed a certain sleepy negligence
on the part of one or two attendants, and they
would be reprimanded. But as for wonder, the Medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Superintendent refused to wonder. Lunatics often stray
or escape, and unless they are dangerous the authorities
made no great commotion about it. They kept it out of
the newspapers as far as it was possible to do so.</p>

<p>“This place isn’t Portland,” said the Medical Superintendent.
“They get back all right. I give him a day. He’s
probably coming back now. He may be hiding up a mile
away. I’m chiefly anxious about his catching cold. Pneumonia
is the standard death of a lunatic. But it’s wonderfully
warm for the time of year. I’ve never known such an
October.”</p>

<p>He was much more desirous to talk to Devizes about
lunacy reform, and convince him that he was a highly progressive
and able Medical Superintendent than to discuss
the special case of Mr. Preemby. “We do what we can,”
he said, “but we’re fixed by the extreme economy we have
to practise. Low-grade attendants and not enough even of
them. The public indifference to lunatics is monstrous.
Everybody—even the people with insane relations—wants
to forget all about them.”</p>

<p>“But how could Preemby have got out of the grounds?”
asked Devizes. “Aren’t there walls all round?”</p>

<p>“Like everything else about lunacy law, the back is not
as good as the front,” said the superintendent. “But here
we have got at least a complete wall of sorts all round.
The original building used to be a private mansion with a
walled park. For a time—in the eighteenth century—it
was a boys’ school.”</p>

<p>He showed them from his window over the roofs of a
clump of outbuildings the limits of the garden and farm
at the back, dropping towards a streamlet and defined by a
roadside wall and old thorn and oak trees. “For my own
part,” said the Medical Superintendent, “I admit the
urgency of very drastic reforms.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Cousin Widgery can throw any light on
this,” said Devizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Widgery?”</p>

<p>“That was his visitor yesterday.”</p>

<p>“<i>Was</i> it?” said the Medical Superintendent, and reflected
and went to his desk as if to look for a paper. “I
thought it was a different sort of name—rather more like
Goodchild. Perhaps I’ve mixed up the names.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sam Widgery,” said Christina Alberta, “would be
the last person who’d want Daddy to get out. He probably
came to make sure that he wouldn’t. He may have come
just for the pleasure of gloating over him. Uncle Sam’s
not a pretty soul. He may have wanted to make sure the
wall went all the way round.”</p>

<p>The Medical Superintendent forgot his doubt about the
name and the paper and turned with a fresh idea to them.
“You don’t think there was any animus? You don’t think
he may have made for Mr. Widgery? Where does this
Mr. Widgery live?”</p>

<p>But neither Devizes nor Christina Alberta thought there
was any great possibility of Mr. Preemby beating back to
Woodford Wells.</p>

<p>“He’s much more likely to go to Canterbury or
Windsor or start straight off for Rome,” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“Or Mesopotamia—or the British Museum,” said
Devizes.</p>

<p>“Or <i>anywhere</i>!” said Christina Alberta with a note of
despair.</p>

<p>They returned to London completely baffled. Christina
Alberta was for a visit to the Cummerdown Police Station
and for a search in the villages round about, but Devizes
explained that this might do more harm than good. Until
now Christina Alberta had never heard of that one kindly
weakness in the British lunacy laws, the release of the
fourteen days freedom. If the lunatic can get away from
the Asylum and remain at large for that period, he or she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
becomes legally sane again, and cannot be touched without
a fresh examination and a new certificate. To set the whole
countryside hunting for Preemby might merely lead to his
recapture by the Asylum authorities. And whatever happened
the mystery must not get into the papers.</p>

<p>“But while we do nothing, he may be lying dead in some
out-of-the-way ditch,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“If he’s dead he won’t mind a little delay in finding him,”
said Devizes.</p>

<p>No, the only thing was to wait at Lonsdale Mews against
the chance of his returning thither. The Crumbs went off
to Shoreham and Christina Alberta was left alone in the
studio, but after one endless day of it Paul Lambone
thought of a convenient agency called “Universal Aunts,”
and a suitable lady was sent to relieve her from a continuous
vigil.</p>

<p>One, two, three days passed. There came no sign from
Sargon, no news of any fresh calling of disciples or visits
to the King. He had evaporated. A vision of a little
crumpled-up body in a ditch replaced the tormented figure
in the cell in the distressed imagination of Christina
Alberta. But the mind refuses to go on with a painful
fancy that leads to nothing, and Christina Alberta’s imagination
presently ceased further dealings with her Daddy
until fresh material came to hand. “He will turn up somewhere,”
she repeated feebly, and became a great consumer
of evening papers. “He will turn up somehow.” Her chief
anxiety was that he should not turn up with too tremendous
head-lines. She began to adjust herself like an early
Christian for the Second Coming. The riddle of her
Daddy’s disappearance became a habit of mind, became,
as it were, a frame, a proscenium arch to her current
activities. Beneath it she returned to the urgent and
extraordinary problem of herself and her relationship to
Devizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span></p>

<h4>§ 12</h4>

<p>It was manifest that he was almost as excited as she was
at their mutual discovery. The possible proceedings of
Sargon, fantastic as they might prove to be when they
came to light, remained for him as for her a matter of
urgent importance, but the thought of this strange relationship
completely overshadowed it. Each had a reciprocal
desire to get at the other, to discover what magic of sympathy
and understanding might not be latent in their
consanguinity.</p>

<p>The evening after the Universal Aunt was installed he
took Christina Alberta out to dine with him at a pleasant
little Italian restaurant in the corner of Sloane Square, and
afterwards he came back to the studio with her and talked
until nearly one in the morning. He showed himself shyly
anxious to find out her aims and purposes in life, and
what she was doing and what might be done to let out her
possibilities. He was evidently disposed to shoulder just
as much parental responsibility as he could, subject to the
preservation of appearances and a proper care for the self-respect
of the vanished Sargon. She attracted him and he
liked her. Her feelings for him were more tumultuous and
abundant and indefinite. She didn’t particularly want help
or support from him. The idea of being dependent upon
him for anything repelled rather than attracted her, but
she wanted to get hold of him, to please and satisfy him,
to be better than he had expected and interesting in fresh
ways. She wanted him to like her—to care for her more
than mere liking. She wanted that anxiously and
tremendously.</p>

<p>She liked a sort of ease and confidence he had with
waiters and cabmen and the common services of life. He
seemed to know just what people would do and they
seemed to know just what he would do; there was no
tension in these matters, no nervous “h’rrmping.” These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
common attributes of habitual prosperity were so little in
her experience that they seemed a distinction of his; and
they threw a flavour of knowing what he was about, and
being serenely in control over most of the conversation,
when indeed he was as curious and experimental and
emotionally stirred almost as she was. The eyes that met
hers when she talked were steady, friendly, interested,
intimate eyes, and her heart went out to them.</p>

<p>Over the dinner he talked at first about music. He had
had no music in his education, and now he was discovering
it. A friend of his had been taking him to concerts, and
he had got a pianola, “so as to spell it out at home first.”
But Christina Alberta’s education had missed out music
too, and she hadn’t as yet discovered it. So that topic died
out presently. He tried her about pictures, but there again
she wasn’t particularly interested. They had a little silence.</p>

<p>He looked across at her and smiled.</p>

<p>“I’d like to ask you all sorts of questions, Christina
Alberta, if I dared,” he said.</p>

<p>She blushed—absurdly. “Any questions you like,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Immense questions,” he said. “For example—generally—what
do you think you are up to?”</p>

<p>She understood what he meant at once. But she was so
unprepared with an answer that she became evasive.</p>

<p>“Up to!” she said, playing for time. “I suppose I’m
looking for my lost Daddy.”</p>

<p>“But what are you up to generally? What are you
doing with your life? Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m at sea,” she said at last. “Lots of my generation
are, I think. The girls especially. You are older than I
am; I’m only beginning. I don’t want to seem cheeky,
but aren’t you better able to say what <i>you</i> are up to?
Suppose—” Her slightly scared gravity broke into an impudent
smile that Devizes found very congenial—“suppose
you play first?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>He considered that. “Perfectly fair,” he said. “I will.
Have another olive. I’m glad you like olives. I do too.
Nobody’s called me to account for a long time. What <i>is</i>
my game? It’s a fair question.”</p>

<p>But not an easy one evidently.</p>

<p>“I suppose one ought to begin right back at one’s philosophy,”
he said. “A long story. But I started the idea.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta was greatly elated at her successful
repulse of his projected cross-examination. Instead of
making a display herself she could watch him. She watched
him over the flowers on the table and had to be nudged
by the waiter when he brought the pheasant to her elbow.
“How <i>should</i> one begin?” he plunged. She had heard of
Pragmatism? Yes. She was probably better read in that
sort of thing than he was. He was, he considered, a sort of
Pragmatist. Most modern-minded, intelligent people he
held were Pragmatists as he understood it. Pragmatist?
As he understood it? He met her eye and explained. In
this sense he meant it; we, none of us, had a clear vision
of reality; nobody perhaps would ever do more than
approach reality. What we perceived was just that much
of reality that got through to us, through our very defective
powers of interpretation. “They’ve done this pheasant <i>en
casserole</i> very well,” he broke off. “Three minutes’ truce we
ought to give it. Do you find I’m talking comprehensibly?
I doubt it.”</p>

<p>“I’m hanging on,” said Christina Alberta....</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’m beginning rather too far off.”</p>

<p>Pheasant....</p>

<p>“To come back to my confession of faith,” he said
presently.... “Mind you, Christina Alberta, you’ve got
to say your bit afterwards.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be as definite as yours,” she said. “Some of
yours I shall steal. But go on—telling me.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep hold, Christina Alberta. I feel I’m going to
be at once hesitating and condensed. And I’m not sure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
what you know or don’t know. If I say I’m an Agnostic
about the nature of the universe, and how it began and
where it ends, does that convey anything to you?”</p>

<p>“Just what I think,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Well.” He started afresh and got into parenthetical
difficulties. The Pêche Melba came to interrupt and permit
a fresh start. He unfolded a psychologist’s vision of
the world for her inspection, a curious and yet attractive
vision to her. He expressed himself in terms of mind and
understanding. She was used to hearing everything expressed
in terms of labour and material necessity. Life,
he said, was one continuous thing, all life was connected.
He tried to illustrate that. The conscious life of most lower
animals was intensely individual, a lizard, for example,
was just itself, just its instincts and appetites; it received
no teaching and no tradition, it handed on nothing to its
kind. But the higher animals were taught when they were
young, learnt and taught others and communicated with
each other. Men far more than any animal. He had
developed picture-writing, speech, oral tradition, scientific
record. There was now a common mind of the race, a
great growing body of knowledge and interpretations.</p>

<p>“People like ourselves are just cross-sections of that
flow. Individually we receive it, react to it, change it a
little, and pass away. We are just passing phases of that
increasing mind—which may be for all we can certainly
say, an immortal mind. Does this sound like Greek—or
nonsense to you?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I think I get the drift of it.” She looked
at his intent face. He wasn’t in the least talking down to
her; he was simply trying to express himself as well as he
possibly could to her. He was treating her like an equal.
Like an equal!</p>

<p>That was his general philosophy. He was coming to the
question of himself now, he said. He became very earnest
over the coffee cups and ash tray on the swept tablecloth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
He spread elucidatory hands before her. He was conscientiously
explicit. He saw in himself two phases, or rather
two levels of existence. Roughly speaking, two. They had
links and intermediate stages of course, but they could be
ignored when one just wanted to express the idea. First of
all, he was the old instinctive individual, fearful, greedy,
lustful, jealous, self-assertive. That was the primary self.
He had to attend to that primary self because it carried
all the rest of him, as a rider must see that his horse gets
oats. Deeper lay social instincts and dispositions arising
out of family life. That was the second self, the social
self. Man, he threw out, is a creature that has become more
and more consciously social in the last two or three hundred
thousand years. He has been lengthening his life,
keeping his children with him longer and longer, enlarging
his community from family herds into clans and tribes and
nations. The deep-lying continuity of life was becoming
more apparent and finding more and more definite expression
with this socialization of man. To educate anyone in
the proper sense of the word was to make him more and
more aware of this continuity. The importance of the
passionate feverish self was then reduced. True education
was self-subordination to a greater life, to the social self.
The natural instincts and limitations of the primary self
were in conflict with this wider underflow; education, <i>good</i>
education, tended to correct them.</p>

<p>“Here am I,” said Devizes, “as we all are, a creature in a
state of internal conflict, quicker, fiercer mortal instincts
at issue with a deeper, calmer, less brightly lit, but finally
stronger drive towards immortal purposes. And I am—how
shall I put it?—I personally am, to the best of my
ability, on the side of the deeper things. My aptitudes and
temperament and opportunities have brought me to psychology—as
a profession. I work to add to the accumulation
of human knowledge and understanding about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
mind. I work for illumination. My particular work is to
study and cure troubled and tangled minds. I try to
straighten them out and simplify them and illuminate
them. And above all I try to learn from them. I seek the
mental or physical cause of their distresses. I try to set
down as clearly and accessibly as possible, all I observe
and learn. That’s my job. That’s my aim. It gives me a
general direction for my life. All the stuff of my mere
individual existence I try to subordinate to that end. Not
always. My monkey individual gets loose at times and
gibbers on the roof. And at other times it’s rather good
company as a relief from overwork. Vanity and self-indulgence
have their uses. But never mind the monkey now.
I do not want to be a brilliant person; I want to be a vital
part. That’s my essential creed. I want to be the sort of
wheel in the machinery they call a mental expert. As good
a wheel as I can be. That’s what I’m up to in general
terms, Christina Alberta. That’s what I think I am.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Christina Alberta, reflecting profoundly. “Of
course I can’t produce a statement like that. You’ve got
your system—complete.”</p>

<p>“And finished,” said Devizes. “You’ve got to tell your
story in your own way. At your age—you ought to be with
loose ends to all your convictions.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I can tell you any story.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to try your best now. It’s only fair play.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful to talk to you like this,” said Christina
Alberta. “It’s wonderful to talk to anyone like this.”</p>

<p>“I feel that you and I—have to understand each other.”</p>

<p>She met his grave eyes for a moment. There was a wave
of emotion within her. She could not speak. She reached
out her hand to touch his, and for a moment their hands
were together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>

<h4>§ 13</h4>

<p>Christina Alberta only got to her confession of faith in
the studio after they had returned thither and relieved
the Universal Aunt. Even then they didn’t settle down
to the business all at once. Devizes walked about and
looked for drawings by Harold; he deduced Harold from
his drawings to a quite remarkable extent, Christina
Alberta thought. He was curious about Fay. “What’s
Mrs. Crumb like?” he asked. “Show me something of
hers, something that seems to give her.”</p>

<p>It pleased Christina Alberta very much to think that
he was shy with her. She felt that this was a recognition
of her equality. He was respecting her and she was very
eager that she should be respected by him.</p>

<p>He got to an anchorage at last in the gaily painted seat
by the gas-fire; and Christina Alberta, after flitting about
the room for a time, came and stood before it, shapely
legs wide apart and hands behind her back in an attitude
that would have shocked all her feminine ancestors for
many generations. But it did not shock Devizes; he found
her more and more interesting to watch, and he sat at his
ease and regarded her with a lively admiration. Most of
us get used to our daughters so gradually; they grow up
and we carry the wonder of them as Milo carried his ox;
it isn’t common for a man to get an unexpected daughter
abruptly at the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>She said she hadn’t much in the way of metaphysics;
she was a Materialist.</p>

<p>“No prayers at mother’s knee? Religion of Mother and
Daddy? School prayers and teaching? Church or
chapel?”</p>

<p>“It all washed out and faded out, I think, as they laid
it on.”</p>

<p>“No fear of hell? Most of my generation went through
the fear of hell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Not a trace of it,” said the New Age.</p>

<p>“But—a desire for God in the night?”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta paused for a little while. “I have
that,” she said. “It comes—sometimes. I don’t know
whether it’s very important or not important at all.”</p>

<p>“It’s part,” said Devizes slowly, “of something that has
to do with wanting to be more than a miserable worm—and
disliking meanness—and so forth.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you know more about it?”</p>

<p>Rather oddly he didn’t answer that. “And how do you
see yourself in relation to mankind—and the animals—and
the stars? What sense of obligation have you? What
do you think the road is along which you have to
go?”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Christina Alberta. She considered she was
a Communist, she said, though she didn’t belong to the
Party. But she knew some other young people who did.
She produced some of the phrases of the movement, “the
materialist conception of history” and so forth. He said
he failed to understand and asked rather irritating questions;
she thought controversially. She didn’t realize at
first how widely apart was their phraseology. As they
talked this became apparent. He seemed to have nothing
too good to say for the Communist idea, for wasn’t it just
his own idea of being a part of a greater being of life?
but he seemed to have nothing too bad for practical
Communism. Marxist Communism he said wasn’t a constructive
movement at all; it was merely a solvent. It
had no idea, no plan. Christina Alberta was put on the
defensive. “Enthusiasm for an ideal Communist state
isn’t nearly so important as the question of immediate
Communist tactics in a decaying society,” she recited, in
an almost official tone. That was how her young friends
in the Party talked. But when she talked like this to him
it didn’t seem so effective. He wouldn’t leave her phrases
alone. He wanted to know what she meant by decay in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
society, whether there had ever been a society not actively
in decay and not also actively in growth, what good tactics
were except in relation to general strategy and whether
there could be any strategy without a clear war-end. She
countered more vigorously than effectively and their manner
became controversial.</p>

<p>He pressed the difference in their opinions. Communism
for him meant a new spirit, a spirit of science
reorganizing the world upon scientific collective lines, but
the whole temper of party communism was contemporary.
It was saturated with the feelings and ideas of existing
social classes, with the natural resentment of the dispossessed.
It had the angry dogmatism of desperate
people not sure of their grip. It needed more of the
passion of creative self-forgetfulness. Many Communists,
he said, were simply reversed capitalists, egotists without
capital; they wanted revenge and expropriation, and when
they were through with that they would be left with
nothing but social ruins and everything to begin all over
again. And they were suspicious and intolerant because
of their want of internal assurance. They distrusted their
best friends, their proper leaders, scientific men like Keynes
and Soddy.</p>

<p>“Keynes a Communist!” cried Christina Alberta in derision.
“He doesn’t accept the first scientific fact of the
class war.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much of a fact—certainly not a First Scientific
Fact,” he replied. “Keynes builds up slowly a conception
of a scientifically organized exchange system. Most of
your friends in Russia don’t seem capable even of realizing
that such a thing is necessary.”</p>

<p>“But they do!”</p>

<p>“Have they shown it?”</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> know of the Russian Bolsheviks?”</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i>? You just look at the labels on people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Nothing genuine without the red label—and everything
genuine with.”</p>

<p>She said he saw things from his “bourgeois” standpoint,
and he laughed cheerfully at her social classifications;
there was no bourgeoisie in England, he said; she attempted
some of the stock cynicisms and sarcasms of the
movement but with an unusual lack of conviction. It was
easy for him to criticize, she said, living as he did on
invested capital.</p>

<p>“It would make it easier,” he smiled. “But really I live
on my fees.”</p>

<p>“You have invested capital.”</p>

<p>“Some. I don’t live on it.”</p>

<p>They had exhausted the dispute for a time. After all
she reflected she hadn’t put up such a bad fight, considering
her age and standing. The momentary glow of
controversial exasperation faded again. They drifted to
the more immediate question in which they were interested,
the question of what she was to do with her life.</p>

<h4>§ 14</h4>

<p>“We progress, Christina Alberta,” said Devizes, “but it’s
still generally the rule that a woman’s life is determined
very largely by the character and occupations of—the
leading man in the play. Have you by any chance been
in love yet?”</p>

<p>She wanted to tell him all the truth about herself, but
some things are untellable. She hesitated and blushed
hotly. “Nowadays,” she said, and stopped. “I’ve some
imagination. I’ve run about London. I’ve perhaps
imagined things——”</p>

<p>His eyes were very searching for a moment but none the
less kindly.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in love—in a kind of way,” she admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>He nodded with a dreadful effect of complete comprehension.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to run my life in relation to any man,”
she extended.</p>

<p>“Clever girls never do. Any more than clever young men
want to spend their lives adoring a goddess.”</p>

<p>“In any case I don’t see myself becoming a child-producing
housekeeper,” she said.</p>

<p>“Even if you married. No. I doubt whether you are
that type. But if you are going to reject that easy way—and
it <i>is</i> an easy way, in spite of what people say—if you
are going to be a citizen on your own as a man is, then
you’ve got to do a man’s work, Christina Alberta. There’s
to be none of the Pretty Fanny business you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>am</i> I?” asked Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you are. And in that case, I guess
you want some more education. You’re clever, but you’re
a bit patchy.”</p>

<p>“I’m good enough to get a job. And then learn.”</p>

<p>“Learn,” he said. “That’s enough to take you all your
time. I’d rather we agreed it’s got to be a student for two
or three years more. You need have no anxiety about
ways and means. You and I are of the same Clan—a
clan of two practically—and I am the head. I’ll see you
through just as though you were a son. And now, what
sort of work is it to be? Law? Medicine? a general education
for journalism or affairs? Doors open to women now—fresh
doors every day.”</p>

<p>To that Christina Alberta could speak a little more fully.
She had been thinking out some of these things. She
wanted to know about life and the world as a whole. Could
she have a good year at physical science, biology and
geology chiefly and anthropology? Would that be possible?
And then if she was any good at medical work,
another year at mental science or politics and public
health? “It sounds ambitious I know,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“Ambitious! It’s an encyclopædia in a year.”</p>

<p>“But I want to know about all these things.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“Could I have longer than that?”</p>

<p>“You’d have to have longer than that.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be asking for so much.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be if you were in trousers. We’ve agreed to
unsex you to that extent. Why shouldn’t you be ambitious?”</p>

<p>“You think I might do work—scientific work—at last—as
you do?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“A girl?”</p>

<p>“You’re the sort of stuff I am, Christina Alberta.”</p>

<p>“Do you think—some day—I might even come to work—to
work with you?”</p>

<p>“Kindred minds may follow kindred courses,” he said,
with the completest recognition of their relationship
“Why not?”</p>

<p>She stood and looked at him with a dark excitement in
her eyes and he had a momentary intimation of all that
he might be to her. Gallant she was and fine and ambitious;
a wonderful life to come out of nothingness into his
own. And she meant this relationship to grow, as well it
might grow, into something very great and deep for both
of them.</p>

<p>He went off at a tangent to talk of the contrast of men
and women students and of men and women as workers.
“You’ll never run parallel with men, you free women, so
don’t expect it. You’ve got to work out a way that is
similar perhaps but different. Different down to the roots.”
He argued that probably the whole fabric of a man had
its qualities that a woman’s did not possess and vice versa,
down even to a muscular fibre or a nerve tendril. A time
might come when we should be able to put a drop of
blood or a scrap of skin under the microscope or apply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
some subtle reagent to it and tell its sex. “A man resists,”
he said. “A man is intractable. He has greater inertia,
physical and mental. That keeps him to his course. Men
compared with women are steadier and stupider. Women
compared with men are quicker and sillier. Bludgeons
and bodkins.”</p>

<p>He talked of his student days when women medical
students were still rather novel intrusions, and from that
he passed to his father’s prejudices, to his father’s treatment
of his mother and his boyish days. Presently they
were exchanging experiences of childish delusions and
fancies. She forgot how much older and more experienced
he was in the ease of his talk. He told her about himself
because he recognized her right to know about him; he
listened with a friendly eagerness to all she chose to tell
him of her Daddy and herself and about her impressions
and her few adventures in encounter as a suburban student
in London. They shared their delight in Paul Lambone’s
kindly absurdity. Presently it occurred to her to offer
him drink. The Crumbs had left a bottle of beer and
a syphon. But Devizes asked her to make tea and helped
her with the kettle. Meanwhile the mutual exploration
went on. Their friendliness grew richer and deeper as they
talked. She had never before met so intimate and delightful
a curiosity as his. She had had friends before but
no such friendliness; she had had a lover but never
such intimacy.</p>

<p>It was one o’clock before he went away.</p>

<p>The talk had ebbed. He sat thoughtful for a moment.</p>

<p>“I must go,” he said, and stood up. They faced each
other, a little at a loss for parting words.</p>

<p>“It’s been wonderful to talk to you,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s a great thing to have discovered you.”</p>

<p>Another pause. “It’s a great thing for me,” she said
lamely.</p>

<p>“We’ll talk—many times,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>He wanted to call her “my dear,” and an absurd shyness
prevented him. And she was aware of that suppression.</p>

<p>She stood up straight before him in the passage with a
flush on her cheeks and her eyes alight, and he wondered
he had not thought her beautiful from the beginning.
“Good-bye for the time,” he said, and smiled at her gravely
and took and held her hand for a moment.</p>

<p>“Good night,” she said, and hesitated and then opened
the green door for him and stood and watched him go up
the Mews.</p>

<p>At the top he turned and waved his hand to her before
he disappeared. “Good night,” she whispered and started,
and looked about her as if she feared that her unspoken
thoughts had been audible.</p>

<p>Father. Her father!</p>

<p>So real fathers leave one aglow like this!</p>

<p>He had left her tense as a violin string on which the bow
rests motionless. Now Daddy, who wasn’t her father, she
would just have hugged and kissed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE SECOND<br>

<i>How Bobby Stole a Lunatic</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">A <small>MAN</small> may be a mental expert and yet fail to take
the most obvious hints in a detective investigation.
The medical superintendent at Cummerdown Hill had
doubted for a moment whether Widgery was the name of
Sargon’s visitor. He had thought it was more like Goodchild.
But since there was no known Goodchild in the
world of Christina Alberta, neither she nor Devizes had
troubled to scrutinize this momentary uncertainty. Nor
had she and Devizes asked themselves why Widgery
should have made a second visit to his cousin. Indeed,
he had not done so. It was a much younger man who
had visited Sargon that Tuesday; he had falsely represented
himself as Sargon’s nephew and given the name of
“Robin Goodchild.” His real name was Robert Roothing,
and he had come for the sole purpose of getting Sargon
out of the asylum as soon as possible, because he could
not endure the thought of his staying there.</p>

<p>Circumstances had conspired with a natural predisposition
to give Bobby a great horror of all restraint. His
mother, a gentle dark creature, the wife of a large blond
negligent landowner, had died when Bobby was twelve;
and he had been entrusted to the care of a harsh, old-fashioned
aunt—to whom the cupboard seemed a proper
place for discipline. When she discovered that he was
really distressed by it, she sought to break his “cowardice”
by giving him quite liberal doses of it—even when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
committed no offence. He went to a school where discipline
was maintained by “keeping-in.” The war eliminated
his father, who died suddenly of over-excitement
while in command of an anti-aircraft gun during an air-raid,
and it led Bobby through some tiresome campaigning
in Mesopotamia and the beleaguerment of Kut to an
extremely unsympathetic Turkish prison. In any case he
would probably have been a free-going easy creature, but
now he had so passionate a hatred of cages that he wanted
to release even canaries. He disliked the iron fences round
the public parks and squares with a propagandist passion,
he wrote articles about them in <i>Wilkins’ Weekly</i> and elsewhere
clamouring for their “liberation,” and he never went
by train if he could help it because of the claustrophobia
that assailed him in the compartment. He would ride a
push-bike except for long distances, and then he would
borrow Billy’s motor bicycle. He did his best to prevent his
craving for the large and open from becoming too conspicuous
or a nuisance to other people, but Tessy and Billy
understood about it and did their best to make things easy
for him.</p>

<p>It was not only claustrophobia that Bobby had to fight
against. He carried on a secret internal conflict with a
disinclination to act upon most occasions, that he believed
had developed in him as a result of war experiences. Sometimes
it seemed to him to be just indolence, sometimes
fastidiousness, sometimes sheer funk and cowardice. He
could not tell. He had a rankling memory of a case
of cruelty he had witnessed in the prisoners’ camp when he
had stood by and done nothing. He would wake up sometimes
at three o’clock in the morning and say to himself
aloud, “I stood by and I did nothing. Oh God! Oh <i>God</i>!
Oh <span class="smcap">God</span>!” And at times he would walk up and down his
study repeating: “<i>Act!</i> You vegetable! you hiding cur!
Out and act!” Meanwhile he obeyed routines and did
whatever came to his hand. As “Aunt Suzannah” he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
excellent, indefatigably considerate, lucid, really helpful.
<i>Wilkins’ Weekly</i> was proud of him. He was the backbone
of the paper.</p>

<p>And now this affair of Sargon’s had twisted him up very
badly between his desire to free the little man, who had
taken an extraordinary hold upon his imagination and
sympathy, and his sense of the immense forces against
which he would have to pit himself if he tried to give him
any help. It was only after a considerable struggle with
himself that he had called at the police station and the
Gifford Street Workhouse. He was afraid of awkward
questions, afraid above all of being “detained.” The workhouse
was a detestable place with high walls and a paved
court and a general effect of sinister seclusion from the
grubby street outside. For the best part of a day after his
Gifford Street visit he hesitated whether he should do
anything more.</p>

<p>“Bobby’s got a grouch,” Susan told Tessy. “He’s
stoopid. Just sits and says ’E ’as to fink sumpfink over.
What’s he fink fings over for? Said I was to come downstairs
again, there was a good girl.... Meant it....
Said so.... Puss’d me ’way.... I do-o-n’t fink I
lo-o-o-ove Bobby ’nymore.”</p>

<p>Great distress. A storm of tears. Tessy was deeply
sympathetic.</p>

<p>But after tea Bobby was brighter and drew Susan her
“Good night picture” and came down and sat on her bed
and talked her to sleep the same as usual, and Tessy perceived
that the worst of Bobby’s trouble was over.</p>

<p>At supper Bobby unfolded his plans.</p>

<p>“I mean to go to Cummerdown Hill to-morrow,” he said
compactly.</p>

<p>“To see Sargon?” said Tessy understandingly.</p>

<p>“If I can. But it won’t be visiting day. That’s Tuesday.
I want to look round.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Billy raised his eyebrows and helped himself to butter.</p>

<p>“But—” said Tessy, and stopped short.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“You won’t be able to see him. You don’t know the
name he’s under.”</p>

<p>“They’ll call him Mr. Sargon,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“His name’s Preemby. He’s a laundryman. They told
me at the workhouse. His people <i>want him to be there</i>!”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand the thought of it,” said Bobby after a brief
silence.</p>

<p>“Don’t follow,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“That nice little thing being made into a lunatic. Like
a little blue-eyed bird he was. High walls. Great louting
warders. Sargon, King of Kings.... I’ve got to do
something about it or I shall burst.”</p>

<p>He looked at once weak and desperate. Tessy reflected.
“You’d better go,” she said.</p>

<p>“But what good will that do?” said Billy, and was quelled
by a glance from Tessy.</p>

<p>“If you can lend me the old motor bike and the side-car.
You’re not using it this week-end.”</p>

<p>“You can take off the side-car,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I may want it,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean—!” said Billy.</p>

<p>Bobby came as near to an explosion as he ever did.</p>

<p>“Oh never mind <i>what</i> I mean. I tell you I’m going down
to Cummerdown to have a look at the place. No doubt
I’m a futile ass, Billy, but I just can’t help myself going.
The poor little beggar’s got no friends. His own family’s
helped to put him away. Families do. It’s an infernal
world. I’ve got to do something. If it’s only to shake ’em
up. If I stay here another day I shall start smacking
Susan.”</p>

<p>“Somebody ought to,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“If he can only keep away for fourteen days clear——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“He’s free?” said Tessy.</p>

<p>“He has to be certified all over again—anyhow,” said
Bobby.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>Bobby discovered that the village of Cummerdown lies
nearly two miles away from the asylum, and does its best
very successfully to have as little to do with it as possible.
It nestles among trees just off the high-road to Ashford
and Hastings, and has one cramped little inn that gave him
a bleak bedroom and accommodated his machine and side-car
in an open outhouse crowded with two carts and a
Ford and populous with hens. The day was still young,
and after he had deposited the elderly rucksac in which
he had brought his “things” upstairs, he set out with a
walking-stick and an air of detached interest to reconnoitre
the asylum and develop his plans for the rescue of
Sargon. That golden autumn was still holding out; the
pleasant lane he followed to the high-road was patterned
with green and yellow chestnut leaves and the trees overhead
were full of sunshine. It was a reassuring day. It
encouraged him. It took him with a kindly seriousness
and made him feel that rescuing people from lunatic
asylums was the sort of work the sun could shine upon
and nature welcome.</p>

<p>It had needed a great effort to get down from London.
He had felt then like a midget setting out to attack an
embattled universe. Amidst the Croydon traffic he had
been half-minded to go back, but he had felt that he could
not face Tessy until he had been at least definitely
defeated. It was delightful to note an increased assurance
within himself as he drew nearer to his enterprise. He
felt much more on the scale of the powers he attacked.
After all, what were laws and regulations but just things
patched up by men like himself? What were prison walls
but the slow work of shirking bricklayers and evasive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
contractors? The attendants and custodians, the superintendents
and so forth he was setting out to circumvent,
were all as fallible as himself. And the thing was urgent
and outrageous, this seizure of a harmless little fantastic,
this frightful imprisonment. It had to be fought. The
world would be intolerable unless such things were
fought.</p>

<p>Queer world it was! Such beauty on these tree-stems,
such a glow, and the delightfulness of rustling one’s feet
through these leaves! But all that was by the way; the
real business of life was to fight evil things.</p>

<p>He came out from between the trees and saw the wide
downs opening out before him and the blocked masses
of the asylum with its broad bare grounds and walls, an
eyesore. This was his objective. In that place somewhere
was Sargon, and he had to be released.</p>

<p>He seated himself on a convenient stile and inspected
that heavy architecture and tried to frame a plan. That
white building in the centre looked like a gaunt Georgian
private house. That was probably the nucleus of the
whole place. Two men were visible in front of it mowing
the grass—patients perhaps. The wall and railings along
the road looked implacable. Two stern-looking lodges
there were, no doubt with a testy janitor lurking within,
and there were iron gates—one open. A van was coming
out, a furniture dealer’s van. For a time Bobby’s mind
ran on the possibility of becoming a tradesman with
parcels or a crate to deliver.... Many difficulties that
way....</p>

<p>“But why a frontal attack?” said Bobby with an effect
of discovery. The place fell away behind, down-hill. He
would inspect the rear. If he worked round by the open
down to the right, he would probably get on to slopes
commanding a view of the asylum grounds.</p>

<p>An hour later Bobby was sitting on a heap of flints
by the side of a minor road which ran over the rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
ground behind the asylum. He found the rear of the
place much more hopeful and much more interesting than
the front. There were fields with a number of men working
in them, and at one place near the buildings a row of men
seemed to be digging a trench under the supervision of an
attendant. There was quite a lot of movement closer to
the buildings, under a sort of open shed half a dozen men
seemed to be taking exercise by walking up and down. It
vexed Bobby to think that any one of these figures might
be his Sargon. If only he had the elementary common
sense to bring a field-glass, he reproached himself, he might
have been able to make out his little friend’s features.
“No clearness of thought,” he whispered. “No decision.”
A lot of these people seemed to be going about very freely,
carrying gardening implements and so forth. One he noted,
walking about and gesticulating as if he talked to himself;
he was manifestly a patient and quite unattended.</p>

<p>The wall bounding the asylum on this side had none of
the austerity of the front wall. It seemed to be an old
estate wall; in several places it was covered with ivy and
here and there it was overhung with trees. The ground
dropped away to his right, there was a little stream which
ran out of the asylum grounds at the lowest corner; the
corner was shaded by trees and seemed to be left to the
trees and undergrowth; the stream ran under a low arch
in the wall and went on down a widening valley towards
London. The seclusion and shade of this corner appealed
to Bobby very strongly. It seemed to him exactly the
point at which Sargon ought to be got out of the place.
He decided that presently he would stroll down and examine
its possibilities as precisely as possible. If one could
get Sargon to come down there——</p>

<p>He found the details difficult. He meant to have a plan
worked out in every detail and to communicate it to Sargon
on the next visiting day, but it was very hard to fit this
plan together. He did not know when it would be most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
convenient for Sargon to attempt to slip away, whether
this was to be a daylight or a night affair. He saw before
him a great vista of inquiries to be made and suspicious
people to be faced. “Damn!” said Bobby, and for a time
he was again for abandoning the attempt.</p>

<p>Why couldn’t one go in at these gates, boldly and overwhelmingly,
and say, “There is a sane man here and I
have come to set him free?” A superman might do that,
or an archangel. How splendid it would be to be a sort
of Archangel-Knight-Errant, a great flaming presence of
light and winged power, righting wrongs, reproving
oppressors, liberating every kind of captive creature.
Then one might do things. Bobby lapsed into a childish
day-dream.</p>

<p>Presently he roused himself, stood up and went down
towards the exit of the stream. The wall struck him as
quite climbable—even by a little old gentleman. The
stream came out meandering among pebbles through a
short tunnel. One could have got into the asylum grounds
or out of them quite easily over the wall by the ivy or
through the culvert. He resolved to come again at twilight
and—just to satisfy himself about his own pluck among
other things—get into the asylum premises and walk
about a little.</p>

<p>Yes. He would do that.</p>

<p>He tried to imagine himself assisting Sargon over the
wall. One could get on the top of the wall and reach
down to his hands. A cripple could do it. The motor
bicycle would have to be waiting up there in the lane.
And then? <i>Where would he take him?</i></p>

<p>This was a new consideration. For a time Bobby’s mind
was appalled and paralyzed by the complexities of his
enterprise. He had not thought of taking him anywhere
in particular.</p>

<p>The days that intervened before visiting day seemed at
once interminable and frightfully swift. He had been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
Dymchurch in the summer with the Malmesburys, and
liked the landlady of his lodgings very much; he wired to
her “Can I come with a relation not ill but overworked for
week or so you will remember me last summer Roothing
the Feathers Cummerdown” and had got a reply, “Glad
to see you any time.” So that was all right. But the rest
of the plan failed very largely to materialize. He made
his nocturnal visit to the asylum grounds without misadventure.</p>

<p>The morning of visiting day found him with half a dozen
plans, and they all had gaps and none seemed much better
or worse than the others. And he had walked round the
asylum grounds at various discreet distances, by night and
day just twenty-three times, not counting loops, returns
and visits to particular points of interest. Fortunately
asylums are much preoccupied with their internal affairs,
and do not keep look-out men upon the battlements. They
do not reckon with rescuers from outside.</p>

<p>Bobby made his final decision among these conflicting
projects over his breakfast bacon. With a resolute sang-froid
and his nerves all a-tingle, he set out for the asylum
to see Sargon and begin the work of rescue as he had
thought it out. First he had to find out what freedom of
movement was permitted Sargon, when it might be possible
for him to get away to the corner by the culvert,
and he had to arrange a time for that meeting. Then
he would have to provide also for alternative times if
Sargon failed to keep his first appointment. Bobby would
be waiting under the wall and the motor bicycle and side-car
would be hidden among the bushes up by the road.
In a trice Sargon would be over the wall. After that they
could laugh at pursuit. Off they would go to Dymchurch,
and there, safe and untrackable, Sargon would keep
indoors until the fifteen days needed to make him legally
a sane man again had passed. And then Bobby could
find out those relations of his and talk the matter over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
with them, and get things on a proper footing. So Bobby
planned it out.</p>

<p>Just at the lodge gates he decided upon an assumed
name. He wasn’t quite clear why he didn’t give his own
name, but an assumed name seemed to him to be more
in the spirit of the adventure.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>When Sargon was informed that he was to be visited by
Mr. Robin Goodchild he was in a depressed mood. He
betrayed no surprise at the name. It seemed to him to be
as good as any other name. It might be the name of some
intelligent inquirer or possibly even some precursor of the
release he still hoped for. His spirits rose. He submitted
cheerfully to a searching examination of his personal tidiness,
and he nodded acquiescently to a warning not to
talk about “<i>every</i> blessed thing” he’d seen.</p>

<p>His spirits rose still more when he saw the dark kindliness
of Bobby’s face. It was the one disciple who had ever
seemed to believe. He held out both his hands in a little
storm of emotion. Whatever sort of muddler Bobby might
be to himself, to Sargon in that moment at least he was
strength and hope.</p>

<p>The meeting occurred in the reception-room downstairs,
for no one from the outside world may ever penetrate to
the wards and the bleak realities of everyday asylum life.
The reception-room had a baize-covered table in the middle,
a black horsehair sofa and numerous chairs; it was
totally devoid of small movables; there was an A B C
time-table and one or two illustrated weeklies on the
table, and the walls bore brown-spotted steel engravings
of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria in the Highlands and
of Windsor Castle from the Thames. There were three
or four groups, each of two or three people, with their
heads together conversing in tactful undertones; there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
several women and one little girl; a tearful lady in profound
mourning sat apart by the empty fire-place and no
doubt awaited a patient; two attendants tried hard not
to look as though they were listening as intently as possible
to the conversations going on about them. The patients
present were all in the sanest phase, “fit to be visited.”
There was no madness visible; at most only a little nervous
oddity. Bobby had been watching these other groups
while he waited, and he had been impressed by a certain
quality of furtiveness in their behaviour. The furtiveness
he connected with the alertness of the attendants. One
affected to look out of the window, the other half sat at a
table holding an old <i>Graphic</i>, and ever and again there
would be a quick glance at this patient or that. It had not
occurred to Bobby that his talk to Sargon would be semi-public;
it was a disconcerting interference that would
greatly hamper him in giving his instructions.</p>

<p>Bobby saw at once that Sargon was very much thinner
than when he had taken his room in Midgard Street. He
looked ill and worn, an effect that was emphasized by the
fact that he was badly shaven and wearing ill-fitting
clothes. His eyes seemed larger and sunken under his
brows and his forehead more definitely lined. Yet if he
looked unhappier he also looked more intelligent. He
seemed more aware of the things about him—less a man
in a dream.</p>

<p>“I have come to see if I can be of service to you,” said
Bobby, holding out his hands. “Your friends and disciples
are anxious for your welfare.”</p>

<p>“You have come to see me,” he said, and glanced sideways
at the listening attendant and dropped his voice;
“me—<i>Sargon</i>?”</p>

<p>Bobby understood that note of doubt and it grieved him.
“You, Sargon, the King out of the Past.”</p>

<p>“They would have me deny it,” whispered Sargon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>Bobby raised his eyebrows and nodded his head as
who should say, “They’d do <i>anything</i>.”</p>

<p>The little man’s manner changed. “How is one to
know?” he said. “How is one to know?”</p>

<p>He sighed. “Nothing seems certain any more.”</p>

<p>“Can we sit down and talk together?” said Bobby.
“There is much to be said between us.”</p>

<p>Sargon glanced round. There were two chairs in a corner,
and in that corner they might be a little beyond the
eavesdropper’s range. “I cannot understand this madness,”
said Sargon as they sat down. “I cannot understand this
Riddle that has been set me. Why does the Power, why
does God, permit men to be mad? When they are mad
they are beyond good and evil. What are they? Men still?
What becomes of justice, what becomes of righteousness—when
men go mad?” His voice sank. His eyes became
furtive. “Dreadful things happen here,” he whispered.
“Dreadful things. Quite dreadful things.”</p>

<p>He ceased. For a little while neither he nor Bobby said
a word.</p>

<p>“I want to get you out of this,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Are my friends doing anything?” asked Sargon. “What
is Christina Alberta doing? Is she well?”</p>

<p>“She is splendid,” he said haphazard. No doubt she was
one of this beastly family of Sargon’s that was content to
leave him here. “I want you to listen to me,” he said.</p>

<p>But Sargon had things to tell. “Everyone in this place
is always thinking about what their friends outside are
doing for them. The poor souls come and talk to me.
They know I am different from what they are. They
write letters, petitions. I tell them that when God releases
me I will bear them all in mind. Some mock at me. They
have delusions. They think they are kings or emperors
or rich men or great discoverers, and that the world has
plotted against them.... Some are suspicious and cruel....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
Darkened souls.... Some have dreadful habits.
You cannot help but see.... Some are badly sunken—degraded—indescribably....
It is very painful, very painful.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes stared blankly at unpleasant memories.</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt that I am Sargon,” he said
abruptly, and looked sharply at Bobby.</p>

<p>“I call you by no other name,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>The momentary acuteness faded again. “That man
Preemby was unawakened. He was asleep—scarcely
dreaming of life. <i>But I have seen!</i> I have looked at the
world from high places. And from dark places too....
Sargon. Sargon is a different person.... But it is
difficult.”</p>

<p>He became silent.</p>

<p>Bobby felt that they were getting nowhere. In his
anticipations of this conversation he had talked and Sargon
had listened. And there had been no one to overhear.
But this was all unexpected. Anyhow, the plan had to be
told; Sargon had to be instructed in his part. He glanced
warily at the people nearest to them. “There are those
among us,” he said quietly and quickly, “who would set
you free. I want to tell you—” On the spur of the
moment he attempted a code. “When I speak of a city
in Central Asia it will mean this place, the Asylum. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“This place—Central Asia. If I am Sargon.... Everything
is possibly something else. But we are still in
England nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“In reality. But I want to explain to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Explain.”</p>

<p>“I shall speak of great discoveries in Central Asia. That
will mean this.”</p>

<p><i>Did</i> he understand?</p>

<p>“<i>Rescue!</i>” whispered Bobby in Sargon’s ear, and glanced
at the attendant and met his eye and was discomposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Tell me about the discoveries,” said Sargon after a little
pause as though he had not heard that whispered word.</p>

<p>“It is a symbol for this place,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>Sargon looked puzzled. The attendant was watching
their faces now. Perhaps he suspected already. Bobby
flushed hotly and plunged abruptly into an account of
the discoveries of an amazing Russian he called Bobinsky.
Bobinsky had found a walled city with no way out. “Yes,”
said Sargon, interested. The attendant was now looking
away. “Like this place,” said Bobby, and more explicitly;
“I <i>mean</i> this place.” There was a river ran through the
city, the city of confinement, and went out by the lower
part. There it was the helper waited. The rescuers. That
was the place for them to wait. Did he understand? At
that point where the trees grew and the river went out
through the wall. They they waited. There they would
wait until the captive king came to them.</p>

<p>“It is a curious story,” said Sargon. “What captive king
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It is meant for you.”</p>

<p>“The river you speak of may be the Euphrates,” said
Sargon. “I dream of the Euphrates.”</p>

<p>He had missed it all! He was out upon some woolgathering
of his own. Euphrates! What had the Euphrates
to do with Central Asia? Or the Asylum?</p>

<p>“Bother!” said Bobby. “I say— It is a smaller river I
mean, a streamlet—in the grounds here. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>A tall sharp-faced woman in a hat of hard black straw
came near them and sat down. Bobby, as he talked, observed
her out of the corner of his eye. Was she the friend
of a patient or what was she doing here? “I speak in
symbols,” said Bobby, still watching and thinking about
this woman. “This city is your prison.” He caught the
woman exchanging a glance of intelligence with the male
attendant who had moved a couple of yards up the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
They knew each other. Then she must be another observer.
“I want no other prison than this,” said Sargon, evidently
quite at cross-purposes. “One prison is enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that,” said Bobby. “Can you walk about
here pretty freely?”</p>

<p>“Not freely,” said Sargon. “No.”</p>

<p>“If you could come out into the grounds. To-morrow.”</p>

<p>The woman turned her long sharp foxy nose towards
him, and stared at him with rather stupid green-blue eyes.</p>

<p>Bobby’s nerve was going to pieces altogether. He was
always more afraid of women than men. This prim
sharp-nosed figure so manifestly listening, and listening
with a faint hostility to all he said, completed his discomfiture.
He tried to improvise a story of lost and
recovered cities that would be crystal clear to Sargon and
yet incomprehensible to the listener. But his invention
faltered at the difficult task. Where the river ran out of
the city, he repeated; he harped upon that idea; where
there were trees and ivy, there the faithful waited. When
was the propitious hour for the Master to steal away to
them? Everything was prepared. When could it be?
When might it be? Fragmentally and mixed with many
irrelevancies Bobby tried to get the import of these suggestions
over to his hearer. Now he would be explicit; now
as the fear of the listener returned, vague and misleading.
He did convey a sense of mystery and intention to Sargon,
that was plain; but he felt he conveyed nothing more.
The time was slipping by. Bobby could have throttled
that infernal woman. More and more did she become
audience to his floundering efforts. He maundered back to
his starting point about Bobinsky. “There is no such
person as Bobinsky,” he threw in.</p>

<p>“Then how could he explore cities?” asked Sargon,
manifestly more and more perplexed at Bobby’s rigmarole.</p>

<p>“He is dead,” said Bobby. “He was just a mask.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“Some men are.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind about Bobinsky. Could you slip away to
that corner? No, no. She’s looking. Don’t answer.</p>

<p>“Now <i>answer</i>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>Bobby felt that he was only puzzling Sargon. But what
else was to be done? He could have kicked himself for
not having brought a brief statement of his plan written
plainly on a little piece of paper that he could have slipped
into Sargon’s hand—or pocket. It would have been so
simple. He could have made a map and a drawing. Too
late to do that now.</p>

<p>Despair came upon Bobby. Everything had gone wrong.
He got up to go and then sat down again to make another
attempt. He felt murderous towards that woman, towards
himself, even towards slow-witted little Sargon.</p>

<p>“It was very good of you to come and see me,” said
Sargon.</p>

<p>“<i>Why</i> did you come?...</p>

<p>“Do you think anything will be done about me?...</p>

<p>“You will see Christina Alberta? When I saw you first I
thought you had things to tell me—important things. One
lives on such hopes here. Here—when there are no visitors—nothing
happens, nothing pleasant. And one is distressed....</p>

<p>“I am interested to hear of those cities in Central Asia
of course, but it is a little puzzling. Did you come
specially about them? Or just to see me?</p>

<p>“You will come again. Even to come down here to this
sitting-room is an event....”</p>

<p>Then in a swift whisper. “The food is frightful. So
badly cooked. It disagrees with me....”</p>

<p>“That woman,” said Bobby as he went, “She has spoilt
everything. I can’t stand her.”</p>

<p>“That woman?” said Sargon, and followed the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
of Bobby’s eyes. “Poor soul,” he said. “She’s a deaf mute.
She comes to see her brother. The whole family is defective
or insane.”</p>

<p>A maddened Bobby returned towards his little inn.
Should he chuck the whole thing? Intolerable thought!
He must make fresh plans—fresh plans altogether. He
must begin all over again. The little man was evidently
wretched. But it was going to be harder to get hold of
him than Bobby had thought.</p>

<p>Bobby had no sleep that night.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>In the night just before daybreak suddenly Sargon woke
up and understood. He understood quite clearly what the
young man had been saying to him. He had said “Rescue!”
Of course he had meant to say “Escape”! That city in
Central Asia was only a parable; he had said as much.
He had been describing a corner of the asylum grounds,
that corner where the stream ran out beyond the work-fields
and the shrubbery where the patients were supposed
not to go. He had been telling of friends who would wait
outside. He had been trying to arrange an hour when
these friends would come there. And Sargon had failed
to understand. He sat up in bed very still.</p>

<p>It was perfectly clear, but through a sort of dulness that
came upon him at times he had not grasped the drift of
it at the time. The young man had shown irritation,
naturally enough. What would he do now? Would he
try again? Were the friends still waiting?</p>

<p>Who was this young man? His name was unknown or
forgotten. But he believed. He had said, “I call you by
no other name.” Sargon! And there were these friends
he spoke of, who waited outside for the king. They must
know. How could they know, if there was nothing to be
known? After all, perhaps it was no dream. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
world was awakening.... But he had failed them. He
had not understood.... They waited without....</p>

<p>How still everything was! A strange unusual stillness.
It was rare for this place to be so bereft of noise. It was
dark and yet not altogether dark. The ward was dimly
lit by a blue-shaded light. The three nearer beds were
unoccupied, and beyond the man who tossed and muttered
almost incessantly lay for a little while at peace. The
man who raved had died three days ago; the man who gave
sudden loud shouts had been taken away to another ward.
Through the open door one could see across the landing
into the little yellow-lit room, where Brand the ward
attendant sat with his arms crossed and chin on his chest
and slept, his patience cards spread out before him. He
seemed to be alone and yet he could sleep like that! Where
could the other man be—the new attendant whose name
Sargon did not know? And yet he felt—some one had just
gone out!</p>

<p>The uncurtained windows showed the night outside, a
darkness that became translucent, a streak of very black
cloud and five pale stars. Across the lower edge of that
oblong picture one could see indistinctly a tracery of tree
branches and the lumpish head of a young oak still
bearing its leaves, the trees along the first hedge. These
outlines grew distincter as he watched. It was like the slow
development of a photographic plate in the dark-room.
The stars dissolved. Had there been five? There were
three; the other two had dissolved into the pale invading
light.</p>

<p>Dared one venture on to the landing? If Brand awoke
he could make some natural excuse. He stood well with
Brand. But the other fellow——?</p>

<p>There was not a trace of him. Where had he gone?...</p>

<p><i>Do it now!</i>—wisest of maxims.</p>

<p>Very swiftly Sargon slipped out of bed and put on his
dressing-gown and slippers. Hush! <i>What was that?</i>...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
Only some one snoring. Nothing more. He went out and
stood on the landing. Brand slept on like a log.</p>

<p>The stone staircase was lit and empty and from the open
door to the left downstairs came the harsh breathing of a
sleeper. All the world seemed asleep for once, except
Sargon and those friendly watchers outside the walls.
Far away there were sounds of bawling and raving, but
these were stifled by distance and an intervening door.
They merely made the nearer silence more perceptible.</p>

<p>Something stirred, a little clicking sound that sent
Sargon’s heart racing. Then a resonant blow. A second
blow. It was nothing; it was the clock downstairs striking
six.</p>

<p>Very quietly but very resolutely he walked downstairs.
An intuition, an instinct impelled him. He felt and peered
at the door and behold! it was ajar! Unbolted! Unlocked!
Brand’s colleague was abroad upon some errand of his
own. The cold air of freedom blew upon Sargon’s face.</p>

<p>The door opened and closed softly and Sargon stood
upon the doorstep of the left wing of the asylum, facing
the dim world of a November dawn.</p>

<p>It was dark but it was clear, a world of ebony outlines
and colourless forms. Everything looked as if it had just
been wiped over with a wet rag. It was cold, but it was
cold without any of the hate and bitterness of wind.</p>

<p>He crossed the gravel drive and came to a stop and
stood looking about him. The heavy building of the left
wing rose above him, a vast bulk that went up into the
paler darkness of the sky. It receded in perspective and
the central block beyond looked like the ghost of a house.
Here and there were orange-lit windows and others fainter
lit by some remote reflected light. In the lodge to the
left of the gates there was also a light. For where there
is madness there is never perfect sleep.</p>

<p>But the asylum was as near complete silence that morning
as an asylum can ever be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>He looked and listened. Not a footfall. It would not do
to be found here by that other attendant....</p>

<p>But the man was snugly away somewhere. No one
would loiter here in this chill air.</p>

<p>What was it Sargon had to remember?</p>

<p>The friends and believers were waiting for him. They
were waiting now. Where the river ran out of the city
wall; that was to say where the little streamlet ran out of
the grounds. That would be this way—to the left, where
the fields dropped down-hill. He stepped on to the grass,
for his feet made loud sounds on the gravel. The grass
hissed crisply. It was heavy with white frost and his
footmarks made black blots in the wet silvery grey.</p>

<p>He walked past and away from the ponderous dark
mass of the asylum into the open, colder air of freedom.
He unlatched and went through the small iron gate in the
iron fencing that separated the trim grass plots of the
front from the cabbage field. It complained a little on its
hinge and he opened and closed it very carefully. He
struck across the field. The path ran before him into a
mist. It came out of the mist to his feet and vanished
behind him. It was as if it went past him while he
marked time. He could not remember whither the path
ran, nor how it lay with regard to the corner he sought.
But every moment things grew clearer.</p>

<p>Every moment things grew clearer. There had been
something dark and brooding in the sky that hung over
him and seemed to watch him. He had done his best to
ignore the vague presence, because he was afraid of his
own imagination. But suddenly he saw plainly that it
was just the tops of trees showing above the mist. That
must be the line of trees along the hedge parallel to the
asylum front. He must go through these if he wanted to
go down-hill. He left the path and made his way slowly
along a frozen ridge of dug earth. He skirted long rows of
stalky cabbages, black and shrivelled and unkempt they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
looked like Cossack sentinels afoot. They all leant
towards him as though they listened to the sound of him.</p>

<p>As he drew near the hedge and the trees he heard a sound
like the feet of an army of midgets. It was the drip, drip
of moisture from the trees.</p>

<p>Far away behind him and quite invisible to him a motor
car scurried along the high-road.</p>

<p>He had some difficulty in finding a way through the
hedge and a bramble scratched his ankle. He told himself
there was no hurry; the friends waited. Beyond the hedge
the ground went down-hill and the mist grew whiter and
thicker. The daylight was strong enough now to show
the mist dead-white. It veiled the stream altogether.</p>

<p>He walked slowly. He had no sense of being pursued.
Brand would not go into the ward for an hour yet; he
might not miss him for a long time....</p>

<p>What a wonderful thing, thought Sargon, is daybreak,
and how little one sees of it! Every day begins with this
miraculous drama and we sleep through it as though it did
not concern us and rouse ourselves only for the trite day.
A little while ago the world had been an inky monochrome
and now it was touched with colour. The sky was blue.
All the stars had gone—but no! not all. One still shone, a
large pale star, the star of Sargon. And the sky about
it was flushed with a faint increasing pinkiness. That
must be the east and that star must be the morning star,
hanging above the outhouse chimneys. Those chimneys
were very distinct. The butt end of the asylum which
had been a black and shapeless monster a little while ago,
had now become a dark purple shape outlined with an
exquisite clearness, eaves and ridges and chimneys and
creasings and window-frames. Four windows shone a fading
orange and two of them suddenly blinked and vanished.</p>

<p>Would anyone look out of a window there and see him?</p>

<p>It did not matter. He would go on down towards the
stream. This friendly mist would hide him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>It was wonderful to be in this white mist and yet not in
it. It was always a little way from him. And nevertheless
it wetted him. How crisp the frosted ground was, but
if one kicked through the surface, it was soft.</p>

<p>Overhead the blueness increased and there was now a
rippled patch of pink cloud.</p>

<p>He went deeper and deeper into the soft mist. Presently
he was walking on long wet shrivelled grass. When he
turned presently to look back at the asylum it had altogether
disappeared.</p>

<p><i>What was that?</i> Was it something talking or was it the
beating heart of some busy elfin machine? Listen! Peer!
Think!</p>

<p>It was the stream.</p>

<p>Now everything was plain and easy.</p>

<p>He walked beside the stream. Near at hand trees became
visible, attendant trees with mist about their waists, white-clad
sentinel trees. The dry grass was ranker here. And
what was this, like a denser lower mist within the mist?
This was the wall. Beyond that wall, almost within shouting
distance now, the friends and believers would be
waiting. How discreet they were! Not a murmur, not a
footfall.</p>

<p>For a long time Sargon stood motionless beside the
culvert beneath the wall. At last he roused himself and
by a great effort and with the help of the ivy he scrambled
to the top of the wall.</p>

<p>No one waited. Some dim four-footed thing bolted
from the frost-bitten weeds below, and then there was
silence. There was no sign of watchers nor helpers.</p>

<p>No matter. If it was God’s will they would come.</p>

<p>He sat very still. He did not feel deserted nor alone.
He was not in the least dismayed. He felt that the Power
who had called him into being was all about him.</p>

<p>Slowly, steadily the light grew brighter. A little cloud
like a floating feather caught fire very suddenly and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
another. A great beam of light, like the beam of a searchlight,
only very much broader, appeared slanting to the
north. Then above a whaleback of distant downland came
a knife-edge of dazzling light, an effulgence, like a curved
knife, like a cap, like a dome, a quivering blazing fire-birth.
And then torn clear of the hill and round and red
the November sun had risen.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>It was full daylight and the mist had dissolved away.
The roofs of the asylum buildings were now visible
over the crest, divested of all magic, bleak and commonplace.
From some point in that direction a dog was
barking.</p>

<p>It was strange that there should be no one here. That
young man whose name he had never known, had made
it very plain that there were friends in waiting here.
Perhaps they had gone away and would come back
presently.</p>

<p>Still it did not matter now very much. At any rate he
had seen a sunrise of almost incredible beauty. How good a
thing the sun was! The thing of all visible things that was
most like God.</p>

<p>Perhaps there were no helpers here at all. Perhaps he had
misunderstood. He was stupid he knew. He misunderstood
more and more. Perhaps presently keepers would
come in search of him and take him back to the asylum.
It might be so that things were decreed. He would not
let it distress him. Life was full of trials and disappointments.
He was feeling now very cold throughout his substance
and tired so that all his energy was gone. With a
start he became aware that there was a man standing up
the slope that overlooked the asylum grounds. He felt
a thrill of renewed vitality. This man was standing quite
still looking down at the asylum. It might be one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
staff looking for him. Or one of the promised helpers.
One of the promised helpers?</p>

<p>Sargon was not so calm and apathetic as he had supposed.
He was atremble from head to foot. He was not
shivering with cold but trembling with excitement. He
felt he must end this doubt one way or the other. Could
he catch this man’s eye? He waved a hand. Then he drew
a dirty little pocket-handkerchief from his dressing-gown
pocket and began to wave it. Now! Now it seemed the
man was looking straight down at Sargon.</p>

<p>He was moving towards Sargon slowly, as if incredulous.
Then he was signalling and running.</p>

<p>Sargon sat quite still. He knew all along they would
come for him.</p>

<p>It was Bobby, close at hand now and crying out, “Sargon!
It is you! Sargon!” Sargon did not wait for him. He
turned about and scrambled and dropped off the wall. They
clasped hands. “You have come to fetch me?”</p>

<p>“I was in despair. I didn’t dream you understood me.
I’m all amazed.... Let me think; what are we to do?
This is splendid. My motor bicycle is in the inn. Nuisance
that. Yes, come along. I must hide you somewhere
and fetch it. Then we will get away. I didn’t think you’d
have no clothes. Clothes? Won’t show much. Cold?
May be cold. I’ll get a rug. There’s a rug in the side-car.”</p>

<p>He led the way back up the slope, glancing ever and
again at the asylum fields. Sargon trotted beside him,
calmly confident in God and Bobby, with the limitless
docility of one who trusts his servant.</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>Bobby’s mind was fresh and bright that morning. He
had wandered out to the asylum simply because he could
lie in bed in a fever of regrets no longer. His extreme luck
in encountering Sargon had restored all his confidence in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
himself and in the propitiousness of things. He made his
plans quickly and with decision. It would be impossible
to take Sargon back to the inn and give him coffee. So
soon as he was missed they would surely go to the village.
And every one would note this queer little figure with its
dressing-gown and slippers and scarred ankles. He must
get the little man into hiding somewhere close at hand.
In that small beech-wood just over the next crest. (Pity
he was so scantily clad!) Then the motor bicycle must be
fetched as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Sargon was absolutely trustful and obedient. “It is cold I
know,” said Bobby, “but unavoidable. I wish there were
not so many wet dead leaves.”</p>

<p>“Only be quick and fetch help,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>“Don’t stir from here,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>It was not the most perfect hiding-place in the world, a
ditch, a clump of holly on the edge of a bare beech-wood,
but it was all that downland was likely to provide. “So
long,” said Bobby and set off at a smart trot for the inn and
the motor bicycle. He arrived flushed, dishevelled, and
out of breath and found the inn suspicious and reluctant
when he announced that he wanted his bill instantly, refused
any breakfast but a cup of tea and a chunk of
bread and butter, and set about packing his little roll.
There seemed endless things to do, taking an interminable
time. To cap a score of irritating delays the inn was short
of change and had to send out to the village shop. Billy’s
motor bicycle, always a temperamental creature, gave great
trouble with its kick starter. And meanwhile Sargon was
shivering amidst the mud and dead leaves under the dripping
trees or worse, being recaptured and led back into
captivity.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight before Bobby came back along the
cart-track into sight of the little beech-wood, and his heart
jumped when he saw two heavy-looking men advancing
towards him. He knew them for asylum men at once;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
they had the unmistakable flavour of subaltern authority
that distinguishes prison warders, ex-policemen, time-keepers,
and the keepers of the insane. As he throbbed
near them they came into the middle of the road and made
signs for him to stop. “Hell!” said Bobby, and pulled up.</p>

<p>They came alongside and without evident hostility.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” said one—and Bobby felt better.</p>

<p>“That large place you see there, sir, is Cummerdown
Asylum. Perhaps you know it, sir?”</p>

<p>“No. <i>Which</i> is the asylum? All of it?” Bobby felt he
was being really clever and his spirits rose.</p>

<p>“Yesir.”</p>

<p>“Damn great place!” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“We’ve got one of our inmates astray this morning.
Harmless little man, he is, and we ventured to stop you
and ask you if you’ve seen him.”</p>

<p>Bobby had an inspiration. “I believe I have. Was he in
a sort of brown robe and slippers with nothing on his head?”</p>

<p>“That’s ’im, sir. Where did you see him?”</p>

<p>Bobby turned round and pointed in the direction from
which he had come. “He was making off along the edge of
a field,” he said. “I saw him not—oh, not five minutes ago.
Mile, or a bit more, away from here. Running he was.
Along a hedge to the right—left I mean—near a chestnut
plantation.”</p>

<p>“That’s ’im all right, Jim. <i>Where</i> did you say, sir?”</p>

<p>Bobby’s brilliance increased. “If one of you will sit behind
me and the other get into this contraption—bit of a
load, but we can manage it—I’ll run you back to the very
place. Right away.” And without more ado he set about
turning round. “That’s a real help, sir,” said Jim. “Don’t
mention it,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>Bobby was now at the top of his form. He loaded them in
with helpful words—even the smaller of the two was a
tight fit for the side-car and the other sat like a sack on the
luggage carrier—he took them back a mile and a half until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
he found the suitable hedge by the chestnut tree. He unloaded
them carefully, received their hearty but hasty
thanks with a generous gesture and sent them off at a
smart trot across the fields. “He can’t have a mile’s start,”
he said. “And he wasn’t going particularly fast. Sort of
limping.”</p>

<p>“That’s ’im,” said Jim.</p>

<p>Bobby kissed his hand to their retreating backs. “That’s
<i>you</i>,” said Bobby. “God help you both and cleanse your
hearts. And now for Sargon.”</p>

<p>He buzzed back to the place where he had left Sargon,
turned his machine round again and then looked towards
the corner of the wood by the holly clump where the little
man ought to have been waiting. But there was no sign of
a peeping head. “Queer!” said Bobby, and ran up to the
place where he had left Sargon crouching in the ditch.
Not a sign was there of him. Bobby looked about him,
baffled and frightened. After all, after everything, could
things go wrong now?</p>

<p>“Sargon,” he called, and then louder, “Sargon!”</p>

<p>Not a sound, not a rustle came in reply.</p>

<p>“He’s hidden! Can he have crawled away and fainted?
Exhausted perhaps!”</p>

<p>Fear touched Bobby with a chilly finger. Had he mistaken
the place perhaps? Had Sargon strayed away in spite
of his promise, or crept back numbed and wretched to the
warmth and shelter of the asylum? Bobby followed the
ditch down to the corner of the wood, and beyond the
corner in the ditch to the right he suddenly beheld a little
old woman, a little old woman sitting bunched in a heap on
a litter of dry straw and fast asleep. She was wearing a
battered black straw hat adorned with a broken black
feather, a small black jacket bodice; a sack was drawn over
her feet and a second sack thrown shawlwise over her
shoulders. She was so crumpled up her face was hidden,
all except one bright red ear, and behind her on the bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
lay two large stakes tied in the form of a cross. To Bobby
she was the most astonishing of apparitions. It was disconcerting
enough to discover Sargon gone. It was still
more amazing to find him so oddly replaced.</p>

<p>Bobby stood hesitating for the better part of a minute.
Should he wake the old thing up and ask her about Sargon,
or should he steal away? Nothing, he decided, would be
lost by asking.</p>

<p>He went close up to her and coughed. “Excuse me,
Madam,” he said.</p>

<p>The sleeper did not awake.</p>

<p>Bobby rustled among the leaves, coughed louder, and
asked to be excused again. The sleeper muttered a choking
snore, woke with a start, looked up, and revealed the
face of Sargon. He stared at Bobby without recognition
for a moment and then gave way to an enormous yawn.
While he yawned, his blue eyes gathered intelligence and
understanding. “I was so cold,” he said. “I took these
things from the scarecrow. And the straw was nice and
dry to sit on. Shall we put it all back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, glorious idea!” cried Bobby, with all his spirits restored.
“It makes an honest woman of you. Can you
walk in that sack? No, we haven’t time to put it back.
Shake it down off your legs and bring it with you. The
side-car isn’t two hundred yards away. You’ll be able to
put it on again then. This is magnificent! This is wonderful!
Certainly we won’t put it back. Off we’ll go,
and when we’ve a good ten miles between us and the
asylum we’ll stop and get some hot coffee and something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“Hot coffee!” said Sargon, brightening visibly. “And
bacon and eggs?”</p>

<p>“Hot coffee and bacon and eggs,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“The coffee there is—<i>beastly</i>,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>Bobby helped Sargon into the side-car and raised the
hood over him, erected the wind-screen, and so packed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
away. He became a quite passable aunt, dimly seen. And
in another minute Bobby had kicked the engine into an
impatient fuss and was in the saddle.</p>

<p>He felt himself now the cleverest fellow that ever stole a
lunatic. Not that it wasn’t the easiest thing in the world to
get a lunatic away. If you knew how.... They quivered
and jolted along the little minor road and so on to the
smooth main highway to Ashford and Folkestone. The
accelerator was urged to do its best. “Good-bye, Cummerdown,”
sang Bobby. “Cummerdown Hill, good-bye!”</p>

<p>The little old motor bike was going beautifully.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>They got their breakfast at an inn near a Post Office a
mile or so beyond Offham. Bobby left Sargon dozing in
the side-car and went to send a telegram to Dymchurch
announcing his coming. There was some delay in the Post
Office, as the post-mistress had mislaid her spectacles.
Bobby returned to find the breakfast nearly ready and to
assist Sargon out of his sack and into the little room of the
inn. The landlord was a short, stout man, with a grave
observant face. He watched this emergence of Sargon and
his progress to a chair behind the little white tablecloth,
with silent wonder. Then for a time he hid. Then he
came back into the little room where the table was set.
For some moments he stood regarding Sargon. “Umph!”
he said at last and turned about and went slowly into his
kitchen where some sort of wife seemed to be cooking
things. “’E’s a rummun”; Bobby heard him remark, and so
was prepared for discussion.</p>

<p>The ham and eggs and coffee were served and received
with eagerness. The landlord stood over them scrutinizing
their reception of his provisions. “Hain’t ’ad no breakfast,
then?” he said.</p>

<p>“Having it now,” said Bobby, helping himself to mustard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>“Come far?” said the landlord after a thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>“Fairly,” said Bobby with judgment.</p>

<p>“Going far?” the landlord tried.</p>

<p>“So-so,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>The landlord rallied his forces for a great effort. “We
get some rummy customers here at times,” he said.</p>

<p>“You must attract them,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>The landlord could make nothing of that. He turned
about and said “Umph”—meaningly.</p>

<p>“Umph,” said Bobby, just saturating it with meaning.</p>

<p>The landlord made a cunning attempt as they were departing.
“Hope you enjoyed your breakfast,” he said. “I
don’t know rightly whether it’s a lady or a gentleman you
got with you—still——”</p>

<p>Bobby’s mercurial temperament was far too high just
then. “It’s hermaphrodite,” he said in a confidential
whisper and left the landlord with that.</p>

<p>But when they had gone a few miles further he told
Sargon he had decided to buy him some socks and a
jacket and trousers at the next shop they saw. “As it is,”
he said, “you are ambiguous. And then we’ll put that hat
and jacket and the sacking by the wayside for anyone who
wants to use them. And I’ll have to send another telegram.
I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>Bobby’s mental state became more febrile as the day
wore on. He developed a wonderfully circumstantial lie
about a cottage and a fire and how his friend had only
escaped with just a few articles of clothing hastily put on.
“Everything else,” said Bobby, “practically incinerated.”
They were going down to take refuge with a variable relation,
a brother, an uncle, a maiden aunt. As the day
progressed the circumstances of the fire became richer and
more remarkable and the particulars of the escape more
definitely thrilling. Bobby told such lies with great sincerity
and gravity; they were a form of freedom—from
reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>Sargon himself said very little. For him this adventure
was a severer endurance test than Bobby realized at the
time. For the most part he was either cramped up and
boxed in under the hood and wind-screen and being jolted
and jumped along the hard high-road, or he was hastily
changing some garment by the roadside, or he was sitting
still in the side-car taking refreshment and being lucidly
but perplexingly, and usually quite unnecessarily, explained.</p>

<h4>§ 8</h4>

<p>Mrs. Plumer, of Maresett Cottage, Dymchurch, was an
anxious widow woman. She had a kind, serviceable heart,
but it was troubled about many things. She saved and
eked out almost too much. She let most of her rooms in
the summer and some even in the winter, but she hated to
think of the things careless lodgers might do to her furniture.
She liked everything to be in order and lodgers
better looking and better behaved than Mrs. Pringle’s
lodgers or Mrs. Mackinder’s lodgers. She had taken a fancy
to Bobby because he had fitted in nicely when she had had
only one room to spare, and because he had shaved in
cold water instead of calling down as every other man
lodger did—there was no bell in that room—for hot. Also
he talked agreeably when he came in and out and didn’t
want more at meals.</p>

<p>She was very pleased when he wrote to take her downstairs
living-room and two bedrooms for himself and a
friend for a fortnight. There were few people in Dymchurch
who got “lets” in November. They might come
“any time” after Tuesday.</p>

<p>She told Mrs. Pringle and Mrs. Mackinder that she was
expecting two young gentlemen, and left them to suppose
that her guests might stay on indefinitely.</p>

<p>On Wednesday she was excited and rather perplexed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
series of telegrams from Bobby. The first said plainly and
distinctly: “<i>Arriving with aunt about four Roothing.</i>” That
disappointed her. She would have infinitely preferred two
gentlemen.</p>

<p>But within an hour came another wire and this said:
“<i>Error in telegram not aunt uncle sorry Roothing.</i>”</p>

<p>Now what was one to make of <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>Presently the child from the Post Office was back again.
“<i>Uncle catching cold fire hot-water bottles whisky.</i>”</p>

<p>The next sensational telegram announced a delay. “<i>Tyre
trouble not so soon later Roothing.</i>”</p>

<p>Then came: “<i>Sixish almost certain good fire please
Roothing.</i>”</p>

<p>“It’s very good of him,” said Mrs. Plumer “to keep me
informed like this. But I hope the old gentleman won’t
be fussy.”</p>

<p>The fire in the downstairs sitting-room was burning
brightly at six, there was a kettle on the hob, there were
not only tea-things, but whisky, sugar, glasses, and a lemon
on the table and a hot-water bottle in both the beds upstairs
when the fugitives arrived. Mrs. Plumer’s first feelings
at the sight of Sargon were feelings of disappointment.
She had allowed her mind to run away with the idea of a
warm, comfortable uncle with at most a whisky-drinking
cold, an uncle who would be, if not absolutely golden, at
least gilt-edged. She had, if anything, exaggerated her
memories of Mr. Roothing’s geniality. So soon as she
held open her door at the roar and toot of the motor
bicycle, she saw that her anticipations would have to be
modified again. Things were rather indistinct in the
deepening twilight, but she could see that Bobby wasn’t
wearing the full and proper leather costume with gauntlets
and goggles complete, that a real young gentleman would
have worn on such an occasion and which Mrs. Pringle
and Mrs. Mackinder would have respected, and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
shape he was extracting from the side-car was not the
shape of a properly-expanded uncle. It looked much more
like a large hen taken out of a small basket on market
day.</p>

<p>As Sargon came into the light of the living-room, Mrs.
Plumer’s disillusionment deepened and decreased. She
had rarely seen so strange and weather-beaten an outcast.
His blue eyes stared pitifully out of a pale face; his hair,
beneath an unsuitable black felt hat, was greatly disordered.
He was clad chiefly in an excessive pair of trousers which
he clutched nervously to keep up; very full they were with
his dressing-gown tails; his too ample white socks fell like
gaiters over his old felt slippers and betrayed his distressful
ankles. He looked afraid. He stared at her almost as
though he anticipated an unfriendly reaction. And Bobby,
too, standing beside him, looked rough and travel-worn
and eventful, and not at all the self-effacing young gentleman
she had remembered.</p>

<p>When Bobby saw the swift play of Mrs. Plumer’s expression
he realized that their foothold in this pleasant, restful,
firelit apartment was precarious. Happily a reserve
lie he had thought of, but not hitherto used, came aptly
to his mind.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a shame!” he said. “They went off with his
clothes. Even his socks.”</p>

<p>“They seem to have,” said Mrs. Plumer, “whoever they
were.”</p>

<p>“Pure hold-up. This side of Ashford. My big bag too.”</p>

<p>“And where did the gentleman get the clothes he’s
wearing?” she asked. Her tone was unpleasantly sceptical.</p>

<p>“They exchanged. I’d gone back along the road to see
if I could see anything of the tyre-pump I’d dropped,
never thinking anything of the sort was possible on an
English high-road. (Come and sit by the fire, uncle.)
And when I came back they’d gone and there he was—as
you see him. Imagine my astonishment!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>“And you never sent a telegram about it!” said Mrs.
Plumer.</p>

<p>“Too near home. I’d have got here first, anyhow. Well,
we’ve had adventures enough to-day, anyhow. I’ve never
known such a journey. Thank heaven, we’ve had our tea.
I think the best place for uncle is bed—until we can
arrange some clothes for him. What do you think, Mrs.
Plumer?”</p>

<p>“After he’s had a good wash,” said Mrs. Plumer. She
was still doubtful, but a sort of kindliness was struggling
to the surface. “Weren’t you afraid when they jumped out
on you, sir!” She asked Sargon directly. His blue eyes
sought Bobby’s for instructions.</p>

<p>“It was a great shock to him,” said Bobby, “a great
shock. He’s hardly got over it yet.”</p>

<p>“Hardly got over it yet,” said Sargon in confirmation.</p>

<p>“Took all your clothes off, they did. It’s shameful,”
said Mrs. Plumer. “And you with a cold coming on.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get him to bed. Of course, if you’ve got anything
for us to eat we might have it first here. Perhaps just a bit
of toasted cheese or Welsh Rarebit, or something of that
sort, and a good hot grog. Eh, uncle?”</p>

<p>“Don’t want much to eat,” said Sargon. “No.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t forgotten that Welsh Rarebit you made for
me, Mrs. Plumer, after I got caught in the rain on the way
from Hythe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I daresay I could get you a Welsh Rarebit,” said
Mrs. Plumer, softening visibly.</p>

<p>“Famous,” said Bobby. “Make a new man of him.
And meanwhile I’ll run the old bike round to the shed.
If I may put it in the shed? You’ll be all right here,
uncle?”</p>

<p>“It’s safe?”</p>

<p>“Every one’s safe with Mrs. Plumer,” said Bobby, and
held the door open for her to precede him out of the room.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about him to-morrow morning,” he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
to her confidentially in the passage. “He’s a wonderful
man.”</p>

<p>“He’s all right?” asked Mrs. Plumer.</p>

<p>“Right as can be.”</p>

<p>“He looks that distraught!”</p>

<p>“He’s a poet,” said Bobby, “besides playing on the
violin,” and so satisfied her completely.</p>

<p>But he did not feel that he had brought the wonderful
day to a completely successful end until he had got Sargon
washed and brushed and tucked up cosily in Mrs. Plumer’s
bright little best bedroom. “Now we’re anchored,” he
said. He went into his own room and sat down for a time
to invent things about his uncle in case Mrs. Plumer was
desirous of more explicit information when he went downstairs.
He decided to say “He’s eccentric,” in an impressive,
elucidatory way. “And very shy.” His uncle, he would
explain, was suffering from overwork, due to writing an
heroic poem about the Prince of Wales’ journey round the
world. He wanted a complete rest. And sea air. The
more he stayed in bed and indoors the better. He filled in
a few useful details of this story, sat for a little while
twiddling the toes of his boots, and then got up and went
downstairs. He felt sure he could carry it off all right with
Mrs. Plumer. He found her waiting for him. The chief
difficulty he encountered was her conviction that the police
ought to be told of the highway robbery this side of
Ashford at once.</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Bobby and for a moment he was at a loss.
Then he decided. “I’ve done that already,” he said.</p>

<p>“But when?”</p>

<p>“I telephoned from an Automobile Association box. To
the Ashford police. It will be in their district you know.
Not in Romney Marsh. Sharp fellows, the Ashford police.
I had to describe the lost clothes and everything. They
don’t let much get by them.”</p>

<p>She took it beautifully. After that everything was easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span></p>

<h4>§ 9</h4>

<p>The next morning found Sargon developing an evil cold
in his throat and chest. His chest was painful and he was
feverish, red-cheeked, bright-eyed, and short of breath.
Bobby did not care to consult a doctor. He believed that
all doctors constituted a league for the re-incarceration of
escaped lunatics. He imagined secret notices about escapes
being circulated throughout the profession. He motored
to Hythe and got ammoniated quinine, several sorts of
voice jujube, two iodine preparations for the chest, and
suchlike trifles that the chemist recommended. When he
returned about midday the patient looked better and
seemed in less pain. After Bobby had administered quinine
and rubbed his chest and made a generally curative
fuss, he was able and disposed to talk.</p>

<p>“The pillow all right?” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Perfect.”</p>

<p>“You ought to doze for a bit now.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Sargon thought. “I shall not have to go back to that
Place again?”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>The flushed face became very earnest. “Promise me not.
Promise me not. I couldn’t endure it.”</p>

<p>“No need to be anxious,” said Bobby. “Here, you are
quite safe.”</p>

<p>“And there will be no need to get into that side-car
again?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It bumped—horribly.... Where is Christina Alberta?”</p>

<p>Bobby did not answer for a moment or so.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought to explain. I do not know who Christina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
Alberta is. I took you out of the asylum because I do
not believe you are mad. But I know nothing of your
family. I know nothing about your circumstances at all.
I just couldn’t bear the thought of you in an asylum.”</p>

<p>Sargon lay in silence for a little while with his blue eyes
on Bobby’s face. “You were sorry for me?”</p>

<p>“I liked you from the very first moment I saw you in
Midgard Street.”</p>

<p>“<i>Liked</i> me? But you believed I was Sargon, King of
Kings?”</p>

<p>“Practically,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“You didn’t. Neither, I suppose, did I.”</p>

<p>The vague blue eyes left Bobby’s face and stared out of
the window at the sky. “I have been very much confused
in my mind,” said Sargon. “Even now I am not clear.
But I realize I am confused. Christina Alberta is my
daughter. The Princess Royal I called her. In Sumeria.
She is a very dear, bold girl. She is all I have. I left her
and came away from her, and I must have distressed her
greatly.”</p>

<p>“Then she may not know where you have been?”</p>

<p>“She may be looking for me.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“I have been trying to remember. It was in a studio
somewhere—with peculiar pictures. I never liked those
pictures. A studio in a Mew. It had a name but I cannot
remember its name. It is stupid of me. Probably Christina
Alberta is there with her friends—still wondering what
has become of me.”</p>

<p>“At the—at the <i>Place</i>, they told me your name was
Preemby.”</p>

<p>“Albert Edward Preemby.... I wonder.”</p>

<p>He lay reflecting for a time. “I remember that for a long
time I thought I was Albert Edward Preemby, a small
creature, a little man living a mean life in a laundry. A
laundry with large blue vans. The swastika. You cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
imagine what a small, insignificant life it was that this
Preemby led. And then suddenly I thought I could not
possibly be Preemby and also an immortal soul. Either
there was no Preemby, I thought, or there was no God.
There could not possibly be both. It perplexed and
worried me very much. Because there I was—Preemby.
I am not good at thinking—all my thinking goes off into a
kind of dreaming. And then when there came evidence
that seemed satisfactory—perhaps I jumped at what I was
told. But Sargon must have been a great king, a very great
king, and I am small and weak and not very intelligent.
When the keepers and attendants bullied me and ill-treated
me I did not behave as a great king should have behaved,
and when I saw them doing evil things to other—other
patients, I did not interfere. Yet all the time I think I
am something different from the Albert Edward Preemby
I used to be, something more and something better. But
it leaves me confused to think who I am, and I am very
tired. Perhaps, when I have rested a day or two, I may
be better able to think about these things.”</p>

<p>The faded voice died away. The blue eyes remained
staring tranquilly at the sky.</p>

<p>Bobby said nothing for a little while. Then he remarked,
“I have seen men ill-treated.”</p>

<p>And then; “and I am not so slight as you are.”</p>

<p>He said no more. It did not seem as though Sargon had
heard him. Bobby stood up.</p>

<p>“You must rest. You are perfectly safe here. If we can
remain unnoted here for two weeks then it will be impossible
ever to send you back to that place again. Are you
comfortable?”</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful bed,” said Sargon.</p>

<p>But beautiful though the bed was it was not sufficient to
arrest the trouble in Sargon’s aching chest. He seemed
very exhausted that evening. In the night he began coughing;
he coughed so distressingly that Bobby went in to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
him. In the morning he was spiritless and did not want to
eat. Bobby sat in the room downstairs working at the pile
of Aunt Suzannah correspondence that Billy had sent on
to him. He was half-minded to appeal to Tessy to come
down and help with the nursing, but there was no bedroom
available for her. Mrs. Plumer pressed for a doctor
and he put her off. Finally, on her own responsibility, she
brought in a young man who was just starting a practice in
the place. Bobby had a terrifying interview, but the young
doctor betrayed no suspicions. On the whole, he was reassuring.
There was congestion of the lungs but nothing
worse. Sargon must keep very warm and take this and
that. No urgent need for a nurse. Keep him warm and
give him his medicine.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Bobby went up to say good night
and found Sargon better and more talkative.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of Christina Alberta and I should
like to see her. I would like to see her and tell her things I
have been thinking about her. I have been thinking out all
sorts of curious things. Perhaps I am not so much to her
as she may think. But chiefly I want to talk to her about
a young man I dislike. What was he called? When I was
last at Lonsdale Mews, she danced with him.”</p>

<p>“Lonsdale Mews!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course. I had forgotten. Eight Lonsdale
Mews, Lonsdale Road, Chelsea. But my mind is very confused
and I do not know what I should say to her even if
she came.”</p>

<p>Bobby wrote down the address forthwith.</p>

<p>“And this Christina Alberta is all you have?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“All I have.</p>

<p>“Twenty. Quite a child really. I ought never to have
left her. But there came a sort of wonder upon me—As
though the world was opening. It made everything else
seem very trivial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span></p>

<h4>§ 10</h4>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“<i>There came a sort of wonder upon me as though the
world was opening.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Bobby wrote that down also. And he sat very late before
the fire in the ground-floor room thinking that over and
thinking over the message he would have to send to Christina
Alberta in the morning. To-morrow he would have
to explain himself and his extraordinary intervention in
Preemby affairs. It was by no means plain to himself
as yet, and to-morrow he would have to make plain to a
probably very indignant young lady why her father had
so caught his sympathies and fascinated his imagination as
to tempt him to this escapade. He found himself thrown
back on self-analysis. He found himself scrutinizing his
own motives and his own scheme of existence.</p>

<p>He knew and understood that feeling, “as though the
world was opening” so well. Still better did he know that
feeling of dead emptiness in life out of which it arose. In
his own case he had thought this habitual discontent with
the daily round, this urgency towards something strange
and grandiose, was due to the dislocation of all his expectations
of life by the great war; that it was a subjective
aspect of nervous instability; but in the case of this little
laundryman it could not have been the war that had sent
him out, a sort of emigrant from himself, to find a fantastic
universal kingdom. It must be something more fundamental
than the war accident. It must be a normal disposition
in men towards detachment from safety and comfort.</p>

<p>He glanced towards the pile of his Aunt Suzannah correspondence
on the table and the next sheet of “copy” for
<i>Wilkins’ Weekly</i> he had distilled therefrom. He rose from
his arm-chair and went back to his work with his wisdom
refreshed. He wrote: “So soon as man’s elementary needs
are satisfied and he is sure of food, clothing and shelter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
he comes under the sway of a greater imperative; he goes
out to look for trouble. So that I would not discourage
‘Croydon’s’ desire to become a missionary in West Africa
in spite of his religious doubts and his peculiar feeling
about black people. Such a region as Sherborough Island
will probably supply him with a good sustained, sustaining,
and ennobling system of troubles. A white man who has
once challenged the hostility of a West African secret society
will have little leisure for morbid introspection. He
will hardly have a dull moment....”</p>

<p>He stopped writing. “Reads a little ironical,” he said
“And not quite Aunt Suzannah enough.”</p>

<p>He reflected. “My mind scampers off from me at times.
Not in the vein to-day.”</p>

<p>The one thing they must never feel about Aunt Suzannah
was that she could be ironical. No! it wouldn’t do. He
ran his pen through the six sentences he had just written
and pushed the sheet away from him. He drew another
sheet towards him on which he had been composing with
great difficulty a telegram to be sent next morning to
“Preemby, 8 Lonsdale Mews, Chelsea.” He read over
various drafts. The current form ran as follows: “<i>Your
father safe but with severe chest cold care of Roothing
Maresett Cottage Dymchurch desires see you discretion
very necessary return confinement fatal results best station
Hythe and cab could meet you Hythe if wire in time but do
not know you personally am tallish slender dark Roothing.</i>”</p>

<p>Properly considered it was all right.</p>

<p>He tried to imagine what sort of girl this Christina
Alberta Preemby would be. She would be blue-eyed of
course and probably very fair; a little taller and rounder
than her father, soft-voiced and rather dreamy. She would
be timid and affectionate, very kind and gentle and a little
incompetent. Perhaps it would be well to meet her at
Hythe so soon as he knew which train she was coming by.
The cab business might be a strain on her. He would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
to tell her what to do. To a considerable extent now he
had made himself responsible for the fortunes of both these
people. And he liked to think that. He liked to think that
perhaps these might become his own people, more of his
own people than the Malmesburys. Because to be frank
about it with himself he was a little bit of an interpolation
in the Malmesbury household. They liked him; they were
perfect dears to him; but they could do without him.
Even that little devil Susan managed without him; she
liked him and tyrannized over him but he knew he wasn’t
indispensable to her. Here at last might be two people
who couldn’t do without him, who might to an extraordinary
extent become his people.</p>

<p>Of course he would have to put on a little more appearance
of strength and determination than was actually his
quality. He owed it to them to keep up their confidence
in him so that he might be able to direct them in their
difficulties.</p>

<p>He would say to her—what would he say to her? “I have
been hasty, I know, but I know something of the strain
that is put upon the sane patient in an asylum. I thought
that the first thing to do was to get your father out of it.
It didn’t occur to me that for a time he might have forgotten
your address. Perhaps I ought to have come to you
before I acted. But then how was I to know there <i>was</i> a
you? Until he told me of your existence. In so many cases
in these asylums the relatives are hostile to release. It is
dreadful to admit it, but it is so.”</p>

<p>Then rather humorously and quite modestly he would
describe the escape. He was already forgetting the uncertainties
of the visiting-day conversation and the numerous
accidental factors in the meeting by the culvert. But all
history has this knack of eliminating unnecessary detail.</p>

<p>So he would make his statement. It did not occur to him
that Christina Alberta might be the sort of person who
interrupts speeches with elucidatory questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>He lit a cigarette, strolled about the room, and came to
rest standing before the fire and looking down on the
glowing coals. He was sure now that Christina Alberta
was blue-eyed, fragile, shy—with a deep sweet vein of
humorous fantasy hidden away in her. Very probably she
concealed a gift for writing. It would be for him perhaps
to discover that and cultivate it and bring it out. Together
they would protect Sargon, already more than half recovered
from the intoxication of his dream. They would
have to soften the humiliations of his complete awakening.
How fortunate and as it were providential it was that he
had been impelled to rescue the little man!—for otherwise
he would never have met Christina Alberta, never won her
timid wealth of love....</p>

<p>“<i>Eh!</i></p>

<p>“But this is all damned nonsense!” said Bobby violently,
and threw his cigarette into the fire. “This is just fancy!
I haven’t even <i>seen</i> the girl!”</p>

<p>He lit his candle, put out Mrs. Plumer’s oil lamp with all
the devices and precautions proper to this dangerous survival
from the Dark Ages, and went up to bed. He stopped
and listened outside Sargon’s door. The patient was asleep
and breathing rather noisily—ever and again choking with
a little cough.</p>

<p>“I wish the weather had kept warmer,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>When he opened his own bedroom door, the flame of
his candle writhed and flared horizontally, the curtains
streamed into the room and a sheet of paper flapped on
the dressing-table. He put down the candle and went to
shut the window. The wind was rising and there was a
little patter of raindrops on the pane.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE THIRD<br>

<i>The Last Phase</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">I<small>T</small> was part of the general unsatisfactoriness of Bobby’s
make-up that he was acutely responsive to meteorological
conditions. That late Indian summer was over now,
and the heavens and the earth and the air between began
to push, hustle, wet, chill, darken, distress and bully him.
Jumbled grey clouds came hurrying across Dymchurch
from Dungeness and the Atlantic, torn, angular, outstretched
clouds with malicious expressions like witches
and warlocks, emitting fierce squirts of rain. Under their
skirts came the waves in long rolling regiments, threatening
from afar, breaking into premature handfuls of foam,
gathering force at last, towering up for a last culminating
thud against the sea-wall and spouting heavenward in
white fountains of suddy water.</p>

<p>“Face it, man,” said Bobby. “Face it. It’s only Nature.
Brace up to it. Think of this poor girl.”</p>

<p>He forced himself to do a morning’s walk along the top
of the sea-wall, with his wet trousers flapping against his
legs like flags against their staves.</p>

<p>“Glorious wind!” he told Sargon when he went in to see
him. “But I wish there was a gleam of sun.”</p>

<p>“Have you any news from Christina Alberta?” asked
Sargon.</p>

<p>“There’s hardly time yet for a reply to my wire. But
she’ll surely come,” said Bobby, and went downstairs to
dry his legs at the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>He did not expect a summons to Hythe to meet the
young lady very much before half-past twelve. Meanwhile
he went out to the shed and assured himself that the
motor bicycle and side-car were in perfect order for a hasty
journey. Half-past twelve came, one, half-past one. He
had some lunch. He became very restless, and rose and
looked out of the window frequently to see if the messenger
girl was coming with Christina Alberta’s telegram.
About two a large, silent, luxurious-looking, hired Daimler
car appeared outside and stopped at Mrs. Plumer’s gate.
A hatless bobbed head appeared at the window and exchanged
remarks with the driver, who descended and
opened the door. The car emitted a handsome and determined
young woman of advanced appearance, hatless and
short-skirted, and a lean, dark, prosperous-looking man of
thirty-eight or forty in blue serge and a grey felt hat. The
man opened the gate for the girl, and she surveyed the
house as she advanced.</p>

<p>Bobby realized that Christina Alberta had not kept her
promise to be blue-eyed and fragile. She had betrayed
him. Yet for all her treachery he had built up a sense of
personal relationship with her that gripped him still. He
watched her approach with an excitement he found difficult
to control. He wondered who the devil the dark man
was. A cousin perhaps. She discovered Bobby watching
her from the window and their eyes met.</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>Bobby, with an instinct that is given to young people for
such occasions, perceived that he interested Christina
Alberta extremely. He parleyed with her and Devizes in
Mrs. Plumer’s little downstairs room. He spoke chiefly
to her. Devizes he treated as a secondary figure, a voice
at her elbow. “He’s got a nasty cold on his chest,” he
said. “He’s been asking for Miss Preemby——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>“Christina Alberta,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>“Christina Alberta a lot. But it was only last night I
could get the address out of him. He’d forgotten it before.
We’ve been here over a day. He caught the cold coming
here.”</p>

<p>“How did you come here?” Devizes threw in.</p>

<p>“Motor bicycle,” said Bobby. “But there was a lot of
waiting about before we could get away and it was a cold
raw morning, and he had just his nightgown and dressing-gown
and slippers. So hard to foresee everything.”</p>

<p>“But how did you come to be rescuing him?”</p>

<p>Bobby smiled at Devizes. “Somebody had to be rescuing
him.”</p>

<p>He turned to Christina Alberta again. “Couldn’t bear
the thought of his being under lock and key. He took
a room, you see, in the place where I lodged, and there
was something innocent and—delightful about him. I’ve
a weakness, a sympathy perhaps, with absurdity....
You ought to go up to him and see him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better look at him,” said Devizes.</p>

<p>(Who the devil was this fellow?)</p>

<p>Bobby asserted himself. “Christina Alberta first, I
think.”</p>

<p>He took Christina Alberta up to her daddy and closed
the door on a warm embrace. “And now, Mr. de Vezes, or
whatever you are,” he said to himself on the staircase,
“where do <i>you</i> come in?” He descended and found Devizes
standing very irritatingly upon his hearthrug before his
fire. As he stood there a remote resemblance to Christina
Alberta was perceptible. Bobby had an incoherent recognition
of the fact that in some obscure way Devizes was
responsible for Christina Alberta’s failure to produce blue
eyes. He was a little slow in saying what he intended to
say, and Devizes was able to take the initiative. “Forgive
my blunt impertinence,” he said, “but may I ask who you
are?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“I’m a writer,” said Bobby, refraining from any glance at
the accumulation of Aunt Suzannah material upon the side
table.</p>

<p>“You’ve finished lunch?” asked Devizes in a disregarded
parenthesis.</p>

<p>“May I ask the same question of you?” said Bobby, “and
how it is you come to be connected with the Preembys?”</p>

<p>“I’m a blood relation,” said Devizes, considering it. “On
the mother’s side. A sort of cousin. And I happen to be
a nervous and mental specialist. That’s why I’ve been
brought in to-day.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Bobby. “You’ve got no intention of—putting
him back?”</p>

<p>“None at all. We’re not antagonists, Mr——”</p>

<p>“Roothing.”</p>

<p>“We’re on the same side. You did well to get him out.
We were trying to do the same thing by less original
methods. We’re very grateful to you. The lunacy laws
are rather a clumsy and indiscriminating machine. But,
as you probably know, if he keeps clear of them for fourteen
days, they’ll have to begin with him all over again.
He renews his sanity. We’re allies in that. We’ve got to
know each other better. Your intervention—most surprising—strikes
me as being at once eccentric and
courageous. I wish you’d tell me more about it, how you
met him, how they got hold of him, and what set you
thinking of an escape.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Bobby, and came and asserted his right to
half the hearthrug. He had thought of the way in which
he could tell this story—to Christina Alberta—the original
Christina Alberta with the blue eyes. He felt that that
version needed considerable revision, indeed, possibly even
a complete rearrangement, for the present hearer. He was
by no means sure he wanted to tell it to the present hearer.
The man was a doctor and a mental specialist and a distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
relation, and he was for keeping Sargon out of an asylum,
and that was all to the good, but it still lingered in Bobby’s
mind that he was an interloper. Nevertheless, he made
way for Bobby quite civilly on the hearthrug, and his manner
was attentive and respectful. Bobby embarked upon
a description of Sargon’s first appearance in Midgard
Street.</p>

<p>Devizes showed himself alert and intelligent. He grasped
the significance of Sargon’s projected visit to the dome of
Saint Paul’s at once. “I’ve no doubt he did it,” said Devizes.
“Neither have I,” said Bobby, “though I’ve not asked
him about it yet.” They pieced together the probable story
of the calling of the disciples before Billy and Bobby had
come upon the procession. “It’s touching,” said Devizes,
“and immense.” Bobby approved these words.</p>

<p>“You see how he got me,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>A distinct flavour of friendliness for Devizes crept by
imperceptible degrees into Bobby’s mind. Difficulties that
had seemed to threaten his explanation vanished; this man,
he perceived, could understand anything a fellow did.
Devizes made him feel that the extraction of Sargon from
Cummerdown by a perfect stranger was the most simple
and natural thing to do imaginable. Bobby warmed to
his story; his sense of humour took heart of grace, and he
became frank and amusing about his difficulties on the
visiting day. As he was telling of the foxy-faced deaf
mute, Christina Alberta came back again into the downstairs
room.</p>

<p>“He takes me as a matter of course,” she said. “He
seems weak and drowsy and his chest is bad.” She spoke
more definitely to Devizes. “I think you ought to overhaul
him.”</p>

<p>“There is a doctor in attendance?” he asked Bobby.</p>

<p>Bobby explained. Devizes considered. Was Sargon dozing?
Yes. Then let him doze for a bit. Bobby, working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
now a little more consciously for effect, went on with his
story. Christina Alberta regarded him with manifest
approval.</p>

<p>By tea-time Bobby had adjusted his mind to the existence
of Devizes and the unexpectedness of Christina
Alberta. All that carried over from his state of expectation
was the idea that his relations with Christina
Alberta were to be very profound and intimate. He still
believed that, hidden away in her somewhere, there must be
a blue-eyed, yielding, really feminine person, but it was
very deeply hidden. Meanwhile the superimposed disguise
struck him as agreeable, alert, humorous, and friendly.
Devizes too he saw more and more as a strong, capable,
understanding personality. He had seen Devizes examining
Sargon, and it was clever, confidence-provoking doctoring.
Sargon’s lungs, he said, were badly congested, especially
on the left side; he was on the edge of pneumonia and
without much vitality to fight it. He ought to be kept
in a warmer, less draughty room with a night-nurse available.
Mrs. Plumer had no room for a nurse, and not an
hour away by automobile was Paul Lambone’s excessively
comfortable week-end cottage at Udimore. A little masterly
telephoning and telegraphing and the cottage was
available, fires were alight in the best bedroom, a trained
nurse was on her way to it, and it was all settled for Sargon,
warmly wrapped up and fortified with hot-water bottles, to
go thither. Bobby found himself a mere accessory in this
new system of things; he was to follow next day to Udimore
on his motor bicycle, for there would be room for all of
them in Paul Lambone’s cottage. Apparently Paul Lambone’s
conception of a simple cottage in the wilderness
involved a housekeeper, several servants, and four or five
visitors’ rooms.</p>

<p>This fellow Devizes carried out all his arrangements with
a smooth competence that gave Bobby no scope for self-assertion.
Sargon and Christina Alberta and Devizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
would depart at five and get to Udimore by six, by which
time the nurse would be installed. Then Devizes would go
back to London and get there in time to dress for a dinner
he had to attend. On Saturday morning he would be busy
in London, and then he would come back to Udimore and
see if Sargon was recovered enough for the beginnings of
his mental treatment. Perhaps the unknown Paul Lambone
would be there too. He was a lazy person, Bobby
gathered; he’d have to be brought down by Devizes.
Bobby was to stay at Udimore for some days. He made
modest protestations. “No, you’re <i>in</i> it now,” said Devizes
cheerfully and glanced at Christina Alberta. “You’re in
for Sargon like the rest of us. Bring your work with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do come,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>The only reason Bobby had for resisting the invitation
was that it attracted him so much.</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>This “cottage” at Udimore, which struck Bobby as being
a really very pretty and comfortable modern house, and
these three people, Christina Alberta, Devizes and Paul
Lambone, who now grouped themselves round Sargon,
exercised his mind in a quite extraordinary way. They
struck him as being novel and definite to a degree he’d
never met in anyone before, and even the house was fresh
and decisive in its broad white grace, like no house that had
ever before held his attention. It made most of the other
houses he had ever observed seem accidental and aggregatory
and second-hand and wandering in their purpose.
But this house was the work of a clever young architect
who had considered Paul Lambone intelligently, and its
white rough-cast walls sat comfortably on the hill-side
and looked with an honest, entirely detached admiration at
Rye and across the marsh to Winchelsea and the remote
blue sea; and it had seats and arbours and a gazebo for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
sitting about in, and up hill was a walled garden with broad
paths up which you looked from the back of the house
through lead-paned windows. You could watch the sunset
from a number of excellent points of view, but it did not
shine upon any room to weary and blind you. There was
a kind wall to shelter hollyhocks and delphiniums from
the south-west wind, and to bear a plum or so and a pear
and a fig tree. Downstairs was mainly one great rambling
room with a dining recess in one corner and the power of
opening itself out into a loggia, and with conversational
centres about fire-places or windows as the season might
require, but there were several little studies about the
house in which one could be shut off and write. Bookshelves
grew in convenient corners, and the house was
everywhere mysteriously warm from unseen and scarce
suspected radiators. The house was so like Paul Lambone,
and Paul Lambone so much a part of his house that he
seemed to be really no more than its voice and its eyes.</p>

<p>Paul Lambone was the first successful writer Bobby had
ever met. Bobby knew various needy young writers, tadpole
writers, insecure writers, but this was the first completely
grown-up and established and massively adult writer
he had ever known. The man struck Bobby as being
stupendously secure and free and prosperous. And the
remarkable thing was that he was in no way a great writer,
no Dickens nor Scott nor Hardy; his work wasn’t, after
all, in Bobby’s opinion anything so very remotely above
Bobby’s own efforts. A certain terseness he had at times,
a certain penetration: those were the chief differences.
In Bobby’s imagination the literary and artistic life had
hitherto had an unavoidable flavour of casual adventure,
glorious achievements, maddening difficulties, wild delights
and tragic unhappinesses. Swift, Savage, Goldsmith,
the Carlyles, Balzac, Dumas, Edgar Allan Poe, these had
been his types. But this new bright house was as sound and
comfortable as any country house, and Lambone sat in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
with as safe a dignity as though he was a provincial banker
or a mine owner or the senior member of some widespread
firm of solicitors. No fears of losing his “job” or “writing
himself out” oppressed him. He said and did exactly what
he thought proper, and the policeman saluted him as he
passed.</p>

<p>If this sort of thing could spring from the <i>Book of
Everyday Wisdom</i> and Paul’s amiable novels, what
hitherto unsuspected possibilities of accumulation and ease
and security and helpfulness might there not be in Aunt
Suzannah’s kindly responsiveness? It had never before
seemed credible to Bobby that a day might come when he
would be secure and his own master, able to refuse limitations
himself and to release other people from limitations.
All Bobby’s life hitherto had been a matter of direction and
eminent necessity. He had been <i>sent</i> to school and <i>sent</i> to
college. He had been on the eve of being <i>put into</i> the position
of agent upon a friendly estate when the Great War
had seized upon him and the rest of his generation and
drilled him and sent him off to Mesopotamia. And after
the war he had had to do something to supplement his
diminished inheritance. Life had been so indicated and
prescribed for him at every stage, his parents’ existence
had been so entirely directed by a class tradition, that
Bobby’s mind was exceptionally well prepared to be impressed
by Paul Lambone’s freedoms.</p>

<p>It was curious to note how completely Paul Lambone
arose out of the present-day world, and how completely he
didn’t belong to it. He had all its advantages and so little
of its standard obligations. He had escaped from it with
most of its gifts. He had to go to no court, follow no
seasons, make no calls, and perform no functions. Was he
exceptional in his circumstances altogether, or were there a
lot of people escaping, as he was escaping, prosperously,
from the old decaying social system? a queer sort of new
people who didn’t belong?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>Bobby sat on the terrace and looked over the back of his
seat at this extremely new but very sightly and comfortable
cottage of Lambone’s, with this freshly arrived idea
of a new sort of people getting loose in the world and
living unrelated to the old order of things and shaping out
new ways of living, very active in his mind. This house
seemed to embody that idea; it was new and novel, but not
a bit apologetic nor rebellious. It was just breaking out
like a new fashion. It was just arising like a new century.
He had always assumed that revolutions came from below
through the rage of the excluded and the disinherited. He
had thought every one took that for granted. But suppose
revolutions were merely smashes-up that hadn’t very much
to do with real progress either way, and that the new age
dawned anywhere in the social order where people could
get free enough to work out new ideas.</p>

<p>New ideas!</p>

<p>Sargon was new, Paul Lambone was new, Devizes new;
before the war there could not have been any such people.
They had grown out of their own past selves; they were as
different from pre-war people as nineteenth-century people
had been different from eighteenth-century people. Newest
of all was this Christina Alberta who had effaced her blue-eyed
predecessor. She was so direct and free in her
thoughts and talk that she made Bobby feel that his own
mind wore a bonnet and flounces. He had gone for two
walks with her, once to Brede and once to Rye, and he
liked her tremendously. Whether he was in love with her
he didn’t yet know. Falling in love with her for anyone
was evidently going to be a quite unconventional, untested,
and difficult series of exercises. Nothing at all like that
unborn normal affair with the non-existent blue-eyed girl.</p>

<p>She seemed to like him, and particularly the way his hair
grew on his head. She had mentioned it twice and ruffled
it once.</p>

<p>A queer aspect of the situation was the riddle of how she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
and Sargon and himself came to be the guests of Paul
Lambone with Devizes in attendance. It was just a part
of Paul Lambone’s freedom from prescription that he
should be able to give sanctuary to Sargon and assemble
this odd, unconventional week-end party. But Bobby had
a sense of hidden links and missing clues. Devizes was a
natural enough visitor, of course; he was manifestly Lambone’s
close friend. But their interest in Sargon was
stronger than Bobby could imagine it ought to be. He
was puzzled; he examined all sorts of possibilities in a
gingerly fashion. Some impulse like his own, no doubt,
but not quite the same, lay at the bottom of this—Sargonism.</p>

<p>Bobby had begun by feeling very hostile to Devizes as an
unexpected intruder on a system of relationships sufficiently
interesting without him. He was glad that he had
to go to London for Friday, and not particularly pleased
by his return on Saturday. Then he found his feelings
changing to a curious respect, mingled with a defensive
element that was almost like fear.</p>

<p>Devizes was more aware of you than Lambone. He
looked at you, his mind came at you. It had the habit of
coming at people. He was more actively and aggressively
interested in things than Lambone and more self-forgetful.
Lambone observed enough to make bright comments;
Devizes made penetrating observations. Bobby often felt
encumbered with himself; most people he thought were
encumbered with themselves, but Devizes to a conspicuous
degree wasn’t. He was a man of science; a man of
scientific habits. Bobby had known one or two scientific
men before, rather wrapped away from ordinary things,
but the interest that wrapped them was something that
wrapped them away from oneself; one had been concerned
chiefly with stresses in glass and another with the eggs of
echinoderms. You always seemed to be looking at the
backs of these fellows’ heads and smiling at their immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
preoccupation. But this man Devizes was wrapped up in
the motives and thoughts of people; he didn’t look away
from you; he looked into you. That grew upon Bobby’s
consciousness. Devizes’ eye lacked delicacy.</p>

<p>He had come down for the week-end chiefly to deal with
Sargon. He went up and had long talks to Sargon. He
was “treating” Sargon. He didn’t go up and talk to Sargon
as man to man, as Bobby would have done. He went up
to a sort of mental jiu-jitsu with Sargon to exercise him
and push him about into new attitudes. Devizes was formidable
enough in himself, but far more formidable as a
portent. He had all the appearance of being a precursor,
the most vigorous precursor—they were all precursors!—of
a new type of human relationships, relationships without
delicate reservations, without rich accumulations of
feeling behind emotions avoided and things unsaid. So it
seemed to Bobby, who didn’t for a moment suspect how
much these people were avoiding and suppressing. Christina
Alberta’s thoughts and speech seemed to him to be
moving about without a stitch on, like the people in some
horrible Utopia by Wells. He compared the vast impalpable
network of “understanding” he and Tessy had woven
between each other.</p>

<p>“New people,” he whispered, and looked Paul Lambone’s
new house in the face. To him they were stupendously
new, an immense discovery. The war had overstrained
him, he realized, and left him too tired for a time to see
new things. He had been one of the vast multitude of
those who had come out of the war in the expectation of
a trite and obvious old-fashioned millennium, and who
expressed their disappointment by declaring that nothing
had happened except devastation and impoverishment.
They were too jaded at first to observe anything else. But
indeed Bobby now realized the European world had been
travelling faster and faster since the break-up of the armed
peace in 1914; and here were new types, new habits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
thought, new ideas, new reactions, new morals, new ways of
living. He discovered himself in the advent of a new age,
a new age that was coming so fast that there hadn’t been
time ever to clear the forms and institutions of the old
age away. They weren’t reversed or abolished, they weren’t
overthrown, they were just disregarded. Which was just
why it was possible to get along for a year or so without
noting the tremendous changes everything was undergoing.</p>

<p>“New People.” Did that apply to Sargon? That was
Sargon’s room: the two long windows between the buttresses.
Was Sargon also an escape from the established
order of relationships into novel things? What was the real
significance of the absurd little man with his preposterous
map of the world and his still more preposterous planisphere,
who wanted to be Lord of the Earth?</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>When Bobby came to talk it over with Sargon it seemed
to him that Devizes had taken the little man completely
to pieces and presented him with the disarticulated portions
of himself. Devizes went back to London on Monday;
he took Christina Alberta with him in his hired
car; but Lambone urged Bobby to stay on for a day or so
to cheer up the patient. Lambone, so far as he could
discover his own intentions, meant to stay on at Udimore
for a week or more and work. Bobby saw Christina Alberta
off, meditated on her for an hour, then gave the rest of
the morning to Aunt Suzannah and the afternoon to
Sargon; and Sargon, who was distinctly better, sat propped
up by two pillows and discussed the dissected structure
of himself.</p>

<p>“Not a bit fatigued,” said Sargon. “I’m having a tonic
now. Every three hours.”</p>

<p>He considered his next remark for some moments before
he made it. “Who <i>is</i> this Mr. Paul Lambone?” he asked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
“It is very hospitable for him to entertain us. Very.
(<i>H’rrmp</i>).... Is he a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“He’s quite a well-known writer. He’s a friend of Christina
Alberta’s.”</p>

<p>“She has so many friends. Young people do nowadays.
And what is this Dr. Devizes?”</p>

<p>“He is a nervous specialist, and he was consulted—he
was consulted about the possibilities of getting you away
from that—Place.”</p>

<p>“Nervous specialist. He is a wonderful talker—most
intelligent and (h’rrmp) understanding. I have a curious
feeling that somewhere, somewhen, somehow I have met
him before. In this life—or some other. It is all quite
vague, and he does not seem to have any corresponding
recollection. No. Probably a coincidence of some sort.”</p>

<p>Bobby saw nothing in the coincidence.</p>

<p>Sargon shut his eyes for a second or so.</p>

<p>“We talked of my recent experiences,” he resumed.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Bobby, helping.</p>

<p>“There has been a lot of confusion about my personality.
It is a trouble more frequent nowadays than it used to be.
Most of my life I have thought that I was a person called
Albert Edward Preemby, a limited person, a most limited
person. Then I had a light. I began to realize that
nobody could really be such a thing as that Albert Edward
Preemby. I began to seek for myself. I had reason—too
long to explain—to suppose that I was Sargon the First,
the great Sumerian, the founder of the first Empire in the
world. Then—then came trouble. You saw something
of it. I grasped at the sceptre—one afternoon—in Holborn—rashly.
Most painful affair. I was sent to that
Place. Yes. It shook me. Humiliations. Hardship. Real—uncleanness.
I doubted whether I wasn’t after all just
that little Preemby. A human rabbit. My faith faltered.
I admit it faltered.”</p>

<p>He mused painfully for some moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>Then he laid his hand reassuringly on Bobby’s wrist.</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> Sargon,” he said. “Talking to your friend Devizes
has cleared my mind greatly. I <i>am</i> Sargon, but in a rather
different sense from what I had imagined. Preemby was,
as I had supposed, a mere accidental covering. But——”</p>

<p>The little face puckered with intellectual effort. “I am
not <i>exclusively</i> Sargon. You—you perhaps are still unawakened—but
you are Sargon too. His blood is in our
veins. We are co-heirs. It is fairly easy to understand.
Sargon, regal position. Naturally many wives. Political—biological
necessity. Offspring numerous. They again—positions
of advantage—many children. Next generation,
more. Like a vast expanding beam of intellectual and
moral force. You can prove it—prove it by mathematics.
Dr. Devizes and I—we worked it out on a piece of paper.
We are all descended from Sargon, just as we are all
descended from Cæsar—just as nearly all English and
Americans are descended from William the Conqueror.
Few people realize this. A little arithmetic—it is perfectly
plain. Long before the Christian era the blood of Sargon
was diffused throughout all mankind. His traditions still
more so. We all inherit. Not merely from him—from all
the great kings, from all the noble conquerors. From all
the brave and beautiful women. All the statesmen and
inventors and creators. If not directly from them, from
their fathers and mothers. All that rich wine from the
past is in my veins. And I thought I was just Albert
Edward Preemby! And at Woodford Wells I went for a
silly little walk nearly every afternoon with sixpence in
my pocket to spend and nothing in the world to do! For
twenty years. It seems incredible.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes sought confirmation from Bobby, who
nodded.</p>

<p>“There was I walking about Epping Forest in a suit of
clothes I never really liked—a rather exaggerated golfing
suit with baggy knickerbockers that my wife chose for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
me—they seemed to get baggier every year—and I was
quite ignorant that I was the heir of all the ages, and that
the whole earth down to the centre and up to the sky was
mine. And yours. Ours. I had no sense of duty to it;
I hadn’t woke up to self-respect. I wasn’t only Sargon, but
all the men and women who have ever mattered on earth.
I was God’s Everlasting Servant. Instead of which I was
rather timid about horses and strange dogs, and often
when I saw people approaching and thought they were
observing me and speaking about me, I did not know what
to do with my arms and legs, and became quite confused
about them.”</p>

<p>He paused to smile at the thought of it.</p>

<p>“It has been interesting to talk to your Dr. Devizes of
the absurdity of that contracted blind littleness in which I
lived so long. We talked of the Great Man I really was,
the Great Men we really were. All the Incorporated
Great Men. You and I, the same. Because in the past
you and I and he were one, and in the future we may
come together again. We have just separated to take hold
of things as the hand separates into thumb and fingers.
We talked of the time when the spirit that is in us made
the first hut, launched the first ship, rode the first horse.
We could not remember those great moments as exact
incidents, but we recalled them—generally. We recalled
a blazing day when a band of men went out across a
sandy desert for the first time, and when a man first stood
upon a glacier. It was—slippery. Then I remembered
watching my people heap up the earth-walls of my first
city. We went out against the robbers of the first herds.
Then Dr. Devizes and I stood in imagination on a sort of
quarter-deck, and watched our men lugging the great oars
of the galley that took us to Iceland and Vinland. We both
saw. We planned the Great Walls of China; I counted our
lateen sails upon our grand canal. You see, I have built a
million wonderful temples and made an innumerable multititude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
of lovely sculptures, paintings, jewels and decorations.
I had forgotten it, but I have. And I have loved a
billion loves—I have indeed—to bring me here. We all
have. We talked it over, your Dr. Devizes and I. I had
not dreamt the millionth part of what I am. When I
thought I was Sargon wholly and solely I still did not
realize my great inheritance and my enormous destiny.
Even now I am only beginning to see that.... It is
preposterous to think that I who have all this past of
efforts and adventures behind me should have been content
to run about Woodford Wells in a ridiculous suit of tweeds
with plus-four breeches that were extremely heavy and uncomfortable—they
tickled me, you know—on hot days.
Yet I did. I did.... Not realizing.... I used to go
on until I could endure it no longer, and then I would have
to stop and scratch behind my knees....</p>

<p>“Of course, when I called myself Sargon, King of Kings,
and proposed to rule all the world I was—Dr. Devizes
called it—<i>symbolizing</i>. Of course, everybody is really
Sargon, King of Kings, and everybody ought to take hold
of all the world and save it and rule it just as I have
got to do.”</p>

<p>He had concluded his exposition. He had spread out
his disarticulated parts before Bobby just as Devizes had
returned them to him.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>“But just what are you going to do?” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of that.”</p>

<p>For a little while he continued to think.</p>

<p>“It becomes all different,” he said, “when one realizes
that one is not the <i>only</i> Sargon. I thought of being a
great king, a great leader, with the rest of the world just
following me. I doubt if I ever felt quite <i>up</i> to a job of
that sort, but I couldn’t see any other way of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
Sargon and a king. Now I do. I did my best, but even
when I went to Buckingham Palace I realized that the
thing was going to be too big for me. I was telling Dr.
Devizes—I told him, that since he was Sargon and King
just as much as me and that almost anyone might become
Sargon and King, then it wasn’t a case for palaces and
thrones any longer, or for being proclaimed and crowned—such
things were as much out of date as flint implements;
and that the real things was to be just a kingly person and
work with all the other kingly persons in the world to
make the world worthy of our high descent. Anyone who
wakes up to that becomes a kingly person. We can be
active kings even if we remain kings incognito. One can
be a laundryman like I was when I was just Preemby, and
think of nothing but the profits and needs and vanities
and fears of a little laundryman—and how dull it was!—or
one can be a king, the descendant of ten thousand kings,
the joint heir to the inheritance of all human affairs, the
lord of the generations still unborn—who happens to be
living in exile as a laundryman.”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“I agree with most of that,” said Bobby. “It’s—it’s
attractive.”</p>

<p>“So far it is as plain as can be. But after that the difficulties
begin. It isn’t enough just to say you are a king.
You have to be a king. You have to <i>do</i>. You can’t be a
king and not do kingly things. But it’s just there that Dr.
Devizes and I—we weren’t so clear. There’s a lot to be
thought out. What is my kingly task? In this frail body—and
what I am? I am not clear. Yet the mere fact that
I am not clear shows clearly where I have to begin. I
have to get clear. I have to get knowledge, find out about
my kingdom. That’s reasonable. I have to learn more
about my great inheritance, our great inheritance, the
history of it, the possibilities of it, the ways of the men
who misrule it. I have to learn about business and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
economics and money; and then when I see it all plain I
have to exert myself and vote and work, and I have to
find out what particular gifts I have and how I may best
give them to our kingdom. Each king must glorify his
particular reign with his particular gift. We agreed about
that.</p>

<p>“So far I do not know my particular gift. Dr. Devizes
says that so far as he is concerned he must work out
human motives and human relationships; his gift and his
natural interest is for mental science. He has his task
meted out for him, his kingly task. But for me at present
there isn’t that much self-knowledge. I have to begin
lower down and with broader questions. I have to learn
about the universe and about the history of this world-empire
of Sargon’s, and of all the things I have neglected
in my dreams and littleness. I have to go to school again.
To learn how to think harder. I don’t mind the fatigue.
But I am impatient. When I think of all that lies before
me, the reading, the inquiries, the visits to museums and
suchlike places, I want to get up right away and begin.
I have lived so unobservant and irresponsible a life that
I am puzzled how to account for the years I have spent.
I have mooned them away. But I am glad I have awakened
to my kingship before it is too late.</p>

<p>“I am quite a young man still. I am a little past forty,
but that is nothing. Half of that was childhood and boyhood,
and much of the rest inattention. For all I know I
may live for another forty years. I’m not half through.
And they may be the best years, the full years. I can
spend three or four just learning—learning the round world.
I shall begin to find out politics, and why men and women
are servile and little-minded. I shall begin to realize how
I can extend to those others this great liberation that has
come to me. I shall begin to have a political life. A man
who has no political life is like a rat which lives in a ship
rather than like a man who navigates it. Then within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
that I shall begin to find my own proper life, my particular
task. It is premature, I think, but I am very greatly
drawn to the riddle of madness and asylums. I do not
understand why there is madness. It puzzles and distresses
me, and Dr. Devizes agrees with me that when a
thing puzzles and distresses the mind the thing to do is
to gather all the knowledge and ideas one can about it—scientifically.
Presently it ceases to distress; it interests
and occupies. And when I was in—that Place, I talked
to some of those poor creatures. I was very sorry for them,
I made them promises to help them when my kingdom
came. And now I begin to see what my kingdom is, and
the way in which I must enter in to possess it. Perhaps
in good time I shall learn and spread knowledge about
asylums, and make things better in them so that they will
not simply imprison people but help and cure them.</p>

<p>“It was Dr. Devizes’ idea, I think—or we may have
worked it out together—that there is a real and important
purpose in madness. It is a sort of simplification, a removal
of checks and controls, and a sort of natural experiment.
The secret things of the mind are laid bare. But
then if poor souls are to suffer that sort of thing to yield
knowledge for others, they ought to be treated properly;
they ought to be cherished and made the utmost use of,
and not handed over to such brutes as we had.... I
can’t tell you. Not yet. Brutes they were.... And in
their sane moments—they all have sane moments, these
lunatics—they ought to be comforted and told.”</p>

<p>The queer little round face, with its sprouting moustache
and its pale blue eyes, stared at Bobby.</p>

<p>“When first I saw you,” said Sargon, “I did not realize
in the least how things really were between us. I was still
wrapped up in vaingloriousness; I thought I was a great
prophet and teacher and king, and that all the world had to
obey me. I thought you were going to be the first and
best and nearest of my disciples. But now I know better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
about myself. And about other people. They are here
not to be my followers and disciples but to be my fellow
kings. We have to work together with all the others who
are awakened, for our kingdom and the great progress of
mankind.”</p>

<p>He went on talking rather to himself than to Bobby.</p>

<p>“I have always wanted to know things, but now I shall
have the will really to know them. I shall be different
now. It seems incredible that a little while ago I was
bothered about what I should do with my time. Now I
am only eager to get at things, and however long my time
may be I know it will be full. It is astonishing to me
that there has been flying in my kingdom for a dozen
years, and I have never been in an aeroplane. I must look
at the world from an aeroplane. And perhaps I shall need
to go to India and China and suchlike strange and wonderful
countries, because they, too, are a part of my
inheritance. I need to know about them. And jungles
and wildernesses that we have to subjugate; I have to see
them. The beasts are under us; we have to cherish them
or destroy them mercifully as the necessities of our kingdom
may require. It is a terrible thing even to be lord
of a beast. All the beasts, wild or tame, are under our
dominion. And there is science. All the wonderful work
men do in laboratories and their marvellous discoveries
are our care. If I do not understand I may hinder. How
blind I have been to the splendour of my life. When I
think of all these things, I can hardly endure to be here
in bed; I am so impatient to get on with them. But I
suppose I must be patient with these poor wheezing lungs.</p>

<p>“Patient,” he repeated.</p>

<p>He looked at his wrist-watch and it had stopped. “Can
you tell me the time? At seven I ought to take some more
of that excellent tonic. It is working wonders in me. But
no! don’t trouble; the nurse will be thinking of it....
It puts fresh life into me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span></p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>But Sargon did not live forty years more, nor thirty, nor
twenty. He lived just a day under seven weeks from that
conversation. He stayed in bed for two days after Bobby
returned to London; then Lambone also went and he became
intractable. As his strength returned he bothered
his nurse more and more for books he couldn’t name or
describe, and for volumes of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>;
and when she declared that seven volumes of that monumental
publication were surely as much as any invalid
could need at one time, he got up and put on his rough
little dressing-gown and came paddling downstairs,
h’rrmping resolutely, to the library. After that he got up
for three days running. A fire was made in the most
bookish corner of the downstairs room and screens put to
keep him warm. But his tonic was driving him, perhaps
it was too stimulating a tonic, and he would not stay in his
protected corner.</p>

<p>The nurse seems to have been a weak, complaining
character, indisposed to act without authority. She telephoned
through to Devizes in London, but she did not
succeed in making clear to him the gravity of Sargon’s
misbehaviour. The crowning offence came when he
wouldn’t go to bed at seven, but instead slipped out, in
an overcoat and a wrapper indeed but in slippers, upon
the terrace before the house. His bare ankles and legs
were exposed to the cold wind. The slow-moving periodic
beams of light from the lighthouse upon the coast, sweeping
across the phantom hills under the clear starlight, had
drawn him out, those processional lights, and Sirius that
white splendour, and the steadfast sprawling glory of Orion.
It was a clear November night with frost in the air. The
nurse heard him cough and rushed out to him. He was
looking at Sirius through Lambone’s field-glasses and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
had to drag him in by main force. She lost her temper;
there was an ungracious struggle.</p>

<p>The next day he was in no state to leave his bed. Yet he
tossed about and exposed his inflamed chest in feeble
attempts to read. “I know nothing,” he complained. For a
while he got better again, and then it is highly probable
that he went to his open window in the night and sat for
a long time wondering at the stars. After that came a
relapse and a week or so of struggle, and then after a
phase of delirium came great weakness, and then one
night, death. He was quite alone when he died.</p>

<p>Bobby had not expected the death at all. He heard of it
from Christina Alberta with great astonishment. He had
been told nothing of Sargon being worse nor of his misbehaviour;
he had been thinking of him rather enviously
as growing steadily stronger and better and gratifying day
by day a happy and expanding curiosity. He had looked
forward presently to another talk and another phase in
this odd belated adolescence. It was as though an interesting
story had come to an abrupt end in the middle, as
though all its concluding chapters had been torn out
rudely and unreasonably.</p>

<p>This mood of frustrated sympathy lasted over the cremation
of Sargon at Golders Green. Bobby went to that
queer ceremony. He arrived late with Billy; the coffin
that held the little body stood ready to glide into the
furnace, the Church of England burial service had already
begun. There were very few people in the chapel. Christina
Alberta in the black she had worn for her mother was
in the front seat, as chief mourner, between Paul Lambone
and Devizes. Behind her with an air of earnest support
were Harold and Fay Crumb, astonishingly in deep mourning
and following the service meticulously in two prayer-books.
An unpleasant-looking individual with a very long
pock-marked sheep’s face, small eyes and habitual-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
blacks turned round and stared at Bobby as he came in.
He was accompanied by a very large blonde lady who
seemed to have slept in her mourning under a bed. Relations
of the deceased? The air of relationship was unmistakable.
Behind, a young woman and two detached old
ladies seemed to be indulging a simple propensity for
funeral services at large. They completed the congregation.</p>

<p>Christina Alberta looked unusually small and overshadowed
by her two odd men friends. It was a grey day
outside, and the general effect of the gathering was thin
and scattered and damp and chilly. The organ was playing
as Bobby came in, and he thought he had never heard
a less musical organ. The service as it went on sounded
more and more trite and theological and insincere. What
an old second-hand damp mackintosh the Church of England
is, thought Bobby, for a striving soul to wear? But
then what can any religion in the world really be in the face
of normal death? Theologically one should rejoice when
a good man dies, but none of these religions had had the
pluck to brazen it out to that extent. None can get rid
of the effect of confrontation with a blank amazing interrogation.
Was there anything within that coffin there that
heard or cared a jot for those sombre mummeries?</p>

<p>Bobby’s thoughts converged upon that still thing within
the coffin. The little face would be wearing a waxen unaccustomed
dignity; the round, preposterously innocent blue
eyes would be closed and a little sunken. Where were
those thoughts and hopes, now, that Bobby had listened
to a few weeks since? Sargon had talked of flying, of
visiting India and China, of doing noble work in the world.
He had said that half his life still lay before him. He had
seemed to be opening like a flower on the first sunny morning
of a belated spring. And it was all delusion; the door
of death that had slammed upon him was already closing
then.</p>

<p>Surely those hopes had been life! In them if in anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
was something of the life that lives and cannot die. But
was it yonder? No. That in the coffin there was no more
than a photographic impression, a cast garment, the parings
of a nail. There was more of Sargon now in Bobby’s
brain alone, than in that coffin. But Sargon, where was he?
Where were those dreams and desires?</p>

<p>Bobby became aware of the voice of the officiating clergyman
driving high, like a flying bird, over the welter of his
thoughts: “<i>But some men will say, How are the dead
raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool,
that which thou sowest is not quickened unless it die. And
that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall
be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or any other
grain: But God giveth it a body, as it hath pleased him,
but to every seed its own body....</i>”</p>

<p>“Queer, tortuous, ingenious fellow that Paul,” thought
Bobby. Now what exactly was he driving at there? Queer
fellow! Bad manners too with his “Thou fool.” A rather
strained analogy this about the seed, “sown in corruption.”
After all a seed was the cleanest, most living bit of vegetable
matter you could have; it had to be sown in clean mould.
Growing plants you manured perhaps, but not seed-boxes.
But there was a queer insistence in the discourse of the
“difference,” the discontinuity, of the new life. What was
to come was to be altogether different from what was
sown. Bobby had never noted that before, never noted
how plainly the apostle insisted that no body, no earthly
sort of body, no personality, ever came back.</p>

<p>“<i>The glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and
another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars;
for one star differeth from another star in glory.</i>”</p>

<p>What was the drift of that? Was it translated properly?
What had Paul been up against in Corinth? After all,
why couldn’t the Church speak to one’s living needs instead
of disinterring this Levantine argument? And that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
analogy of the seed; was it after all a good one? Whatever
comes from a seed must itself die again; it is no more
immortal than the plant that came before it. The clergyman
was going too fast, too, to follow him closely. Better
get a prayer-book at home afterwards and read all this.</p>

<p>“<i>O Grave where is thy sting? O death where is thy victory?
The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is
in the law.</i>”</p>

<p>No. There was no following that. It sounded like
nonsense. One just missed the implications. It was like
listening to some one who was too far off to be heard
distinctly but who made eloquent gestures and noises.</p>

<p>The service came to an embarrassed pause. Everyone
was motionless, arrested.</p>

<p>“<i>Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live....
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower; he
fleeth as it were a shadow....</i>”</p>

<p>Set in motion by unseen hands the coffin went gliding
towards the furnace doors which opened to receive it.
There was a deep roar, a sound like a mighty rushing wind,
an elemental and chaotic sound....</p>

<p>Life is a faint dispersed film upon one little planet, but
flames roar like this and great winds rush and whirl, out
to the remotest star in the unfathomable depths of space.
That deep disorderly tumult is the true voice of lifeless
matter, not of dead matter, for what has never lived cannot
be dead, but of lifeless matter, outside of and beneath and
beyond life.</p>

<p>Everyone in the chapel seemed still and bowed and
hushed and dwarfed to minute dimensions until the furnace
doors had closed again upon that soulless devouring
clamour.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THE FOURTH<br>

<i>May at Udimore</i></h3>
</div>

<h4>§ 1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">B<small>OBBY</small> <i>forgot</i> that glimpse of the elemental powers
that the furnace doors had given him altogether, for
such things do not remain naturally in the mind. They
inconvenience life. But the voice of the clergyman hustling
the arguments of St. Paul along, and the scene in the
Crematorium Chapel with the little coffin waiting to be
launched into eternity and the few still black mourners
dotted among the yellow benches came back to him very
vividly when Paul Lambone began to quote and twist those
familiar sentences about the contrast between the corruptible
and the incorruptible and expand a fantastic philosophy
of his own. Bobby had always intended to read that
funeral service over again slowly and judicially, but he
had never done so and he regretted it now very much. It
left him—and Paul of Tarsus—at the mercy of Paul
Lambone, and he knew that Paul Lambone loved ingenious
slight misquotations.</p>

<p>It was a very warm, serenely still May evening, and
Lambone’s party sat after dinner in the twilight, some
just inside the house and some on deck-chairs upon the
terrace. They looked out over the marsh and over the
still sea. The sky was like the inside of a deep blue globe
on which an ever increasing multitude of starry midges
was alighting, and Rye and Winchelsea crouched low
beneath it, black low lumps with a street light and a window
or so showing minutely. Receding out to sea was a liner
quite brightly lit. With a swift steadiness the beam of the
nearer lighthouse swept the distant flats, came near, lit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
the faces of the talkers, lit the room, called a church tower
and a group of trees into existence and dropped them back
into the darkness and forgot about them and passed on.
And then presently it was coming again, a thin white
streak of light hurrying far away across the levels.</p>

<p>When one’s attention wandered from the talk one became
aware of an abundance of nightingales. They were
nightingales newly come from the south. One or it might
be two were in the trees close at hand; others remoter
wove a gauze curtain of faint sweet sounds over the visible
universe.</p>

<p>Bobby sat on the step between the room and the terrace
with his back against a pillar and with his empty coffee-cup
beside him. He had put himself there by the feet of
Christina Alberta, who was deep in a big arm-chair and
very still. Her face was dim except when her cigarette
glowed and showed a red-lit unfamiliar face. And yet
that afternoon she had been the most familiar thing in
the world to him; she had kissed him and pulled his ears
and he had kissed her bare shoulders and clasped her in his
arms. Devizes too was silent and preoccupied. He sat
over against Christina Alberta on the other side of the
opening of the room; and he was so much in the twilight
that except when the lighthouse beam lit his face, only
his shining shoes and socks were clearly visible to Bobby.
There had been times when Bobby had thought that
Devizes was in love with Christina Alberta, and he had
a vague inexplicable feeling that to some extent she was
or had been in love with Devizes. He had a sense of
unfathomed deeps in their relationship, but he did not
know where these deeps lay. If Christina Alberta loved
Devizes she would have said so. Bobby knew of no reason
why she should not. But to-day she had hugged and
kissed Bobby so that it was impossible to believe she loved
anyone else.</p>

<p>Yet in the last three or four months she had gone about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
with Devizes a lot; Bobby had seen her mind responding
and changing with her talks with this man. She used to
quote him, and she would say things exactly like the things
he said. It had been a great inconvenience and trial to
Bobby, this preoccupation. And then suddenly he found
Devizes wasn’t the lover at all, never could have been a
lover. That day she had proved that up to the hilt. And
now in a state between pride and servitude Bobby sat at
her feet. He sat at her feet and close to her; Devizes in the
darkness was remote, a full three yards away.</p>

<p>Except for Lambone’s unquenchable flow it had not been
a very talkative party. To-night it was less talkative than
ever. “This is too perfect,” Margaret Means had sighed.
“I can’t talk. I just thank God I am alive,” and she had
nestled into her big deck-chair upon the terrace. This
was the girl—it had suddenly become apparent to Bobby
a fortnight ago in London—whom Devizes intended to
marry. Abruptly she had come upon the scene to destroy
the triangle that had obsessed Bobby’s imagination. A
sweetly pretty fragile thing she was; in the twilight she
seemed as faint and fragrant as nightstock, and she was a
wonderful pianist. Last night she had played for two
hours. Paul’s sister, Miss Lambone, had been evoked
from somewhere in the west of England to come and be
hostess to the engaged couple. Bobby had tried to talk
to Christina Alberta about Margaret, but Christina Alberta
hadn’t wanted to talk about her. “You see,” said Christina
Alberta compactly, “she has opened the whole world of
music to him. That’s what brought them together. She’s
clever; she’s very clear and clever.</p>

<p>“I’d never heard of her—until you mentioned their engagement.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone to concerts together and that sort of thing.
He’s known her much longer than he has known me.”</p>

<p>“When did you first meet Devizes?”</p>

<p>“About the time my Daddy came to Midgard Street. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
recently as that. It’s hardly six months. Paul Lambone
took me to him to get advice about Daddy. But <i>they</i>
have been going about—for more than a year. I thought
it was just music that interested them. They’d seemed to
be friends. And I thought he didn’t mean to marry again.
He just suddenly decided.”</p>

<p>Christina Alberta reflected. “That’s the way with life,
Bobby. Things accumulate, and then you suddenly
decide.”</p>

<p>“Had she been undecided? Had she made him wait?”</p>

<p>“Not her,” said Christina Alberta with a remarkable
hardness in her voice.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “<i>He</i> decided.”</p>

<p>She seemed to feel there was still something to express.
“He just took hold of the situation.”</p>

<h4>§ 2</h4>

<p>This was Bobby’s second visit to Udimore. Paul Lambone
had suddenly seen fit to gather this party; apparently
on the spur of Devizes’ engagement. In the interval Bobby
had seen Christina Alberta a number of times and developed
an immense sense of relationship to her. It filled his life.
He had always been dreaming things about her from the
time when he anticipated her with blue eyes and a fragile
person, and always she was and did things that tore his
dreams to shreds. This made her profoundly interesting.
More and more he had become dependent upon her for interest.
He wanted to marry her if only to make sure he
wouldn’t lose the interest of her. She had refused—twice.
Without any of the graces proper to the occasion. “No fear,
Bobby,” she said. “It wouldn’t do. I’m not the woman
you take me for.”</p>

<p>“You never are,” he said. “I don’t mind that.”</p>

<p>“You’re the dearest companion,” she said. “I like the
way your hair grows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>“Then why not make it yours, and be companions for
ever?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more frightful,” she said, and so dismissed the
proposal.</p>

<p>They went about together; they spent much of their
spare time together except for those distressing occasions
when she would suddenly throw him over to go to a theatre
or walk with Devizes. Or to go to Devizes to talk. She
never hesitated to throw him over for Devizes. Yet Bobby
got a lot of her. She didn’t know much about theatres
or music-halls or restaurants or dancing-places or that sort
of thing, and Bobby was discreetly competent in that
province. The Malmesburys felt themselves deserted, and
Susan was vindictive in her resentment at his frequent
absence from her bed-time rituals. Tessy, Bobby declared,
remained his dearest friend; but when he tried to tell her
all about himself in the old, old fashion—which he did when
Christina Alberta was away with Devizes—he naturally
had to tell her all about Christina Alberta. But Tessy
declined in the most emphatic way to be told about Christina
Alberta. It was extremely surprising and disappointing
to Bobby to find out how incapable Tessy was of
appreciating the endless interestingness and charm of
Christina Alberta. It was a blind spot in her mind. She
seemed to assume that Christina Alberta was no better
than she should be, whereas she was much better. It
estranged Bobby and Tessy very much, and it was a great
sorrow to Bobby.</p>

<p>Because Christina Alberta <i>was</i> good—and interesting—beyond
dispute. She was growing with tremendous rapidity
mentally and in her knowledge of the world. Every
time he met her she seemed more of a person, with richer,
fuller, more commanding ideas. She seemed to be living
every moment of her time. She was working now at the
Royal College of Science under Macbride. She was taking
hold of her new studies there with tremendous enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
She was in love with comparative anatomy. Bobby
had always thought that comparative anatomy was
dry, pedantic stuff about bones, but she declared it lit up
the whole story of life for her. It changed her ideas about
the world and about herself profoundly. “It is the most
romantic stuff I have ever read or thought about,” she said.
“It makes human history seem silly.”</p>

<p>She took him three times to the Natural History Museum
at South Kensington to show him something of the fine
realizations that stirred her mind. She made it clear to
him how the bones of a wing or the scratches of a flint
could restore the storms and sunlight and passions of ten
million years ago.</p>

<p>And then suddenly a week ago Christina Alberta had
consented to marry Bobby. She had taken back her two
refusals. But the way she did it made it like everything
else she did, astonishing and disconcerting. She had a
confession to make, and for a time until he could think
it over thoroughly that confession seemed to Bobby to
explain her refusals completely and to clear up everything
about her.</p>

<p>She got him to take her to Hampton Court. But they
did not go into the gardens because they saw through the
park gates that the chestnuts of Bushey Avenue were in
full blossom; they went instead by the pond and up under
the riotously flowering branches. A belated spring was
coming now in a hurry, warm and brilliant. The trees
were glorious. It was as if a bright green sea was splashing
up warm creamy foam under a shower of cannon shots.
The blue sky hummed with light.</p>

<p>“The spring has come fast now that it has begun to
come,” she said.</p>

<p>He felt she had something to say and waited.</p>

<p>“I never know, Bobby—this year less than ever—whether
spring is the happiest time in the year or the most miserably
restless. Everybody and everything is falling in love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>“I didn’t wait for spring,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“But what of the frogs that can’t find water?” said Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“There’s water where there are frogs,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“Everybody is marrying and giving in marriage,” she
said. “I thought—I thought—Dr. Devizes at least was an
inconsolable widower. But the spring tides have caught
even him. They catch everybody.”</p>

<p>“They’ve caught you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m miserable, Bobby, and restless and
all astir.”</p>

<p>“Then let yourself go.”</p>

<p>“One aches—alone.”</p>

<p>“But are you alone?”</p>

<p>“Fairly.”</p>

<p>“There’s me.”</p>

<p>“Bobby dear, what do you want in me?”</p>

<p>“<i>You.</i> To be with you. To be always about with you.
And to be loved by you.”</p>

<p>“It’s kind of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! <i>Kindness!</i>”</p>

<p>“Listen, Bobby,” she said, and made a long pause.</p>

<p>Her voice when she spoke had adopted the ease of casual
conversation. “Do you believe in chastity, Bobby? Could
you love a girl who wasn’t—chaste?”</p>

<p>Bobby winced as if she had struck his face with a whip.
He went white. “What do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Plainly,” she said.</p>

<p>For a time neither of them said a word.</p>

<p>“You have had <i>your</i> experiences,” she thrust. “In France.
They all did.”</p>

<p>Bobby made no answer to that.</p>

<p>“Now you know,” she flung at him.</p>

<p>For a little while the light had gone out of Bobby’s
world.</p>

<p>“Did you love the man?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>“If I did I don’t remember it. It was just—curiosity.
And the stir of growing up. And the intolerable sense of
being forbidden. No—I think I was almost—cold-blooded.
I liked the look of him. And then I disliked him....
But there it is, Bobby. That’s how things are.”</p>

<p>Bobby weighed his words. “I’d care if it were any girl
but you. You—you’re different. I love you. What has
or hasn’t happened to you doesn’t matter. At least—it
doesn’t matter so much.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure it doesn’t matter so much?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Sure for good?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“From this moment you forget, you begin to forget what
I have told you? As I want to forget it?”</p>

<p>“It will go soon enough if you want to forget it. It
doesn’t matter at all. I see now, it doesn’t matter at all.”</p>

<p>“But why on earth do you want to marry me, Bobby?
What is there in me? I’m ugly, rude, greedy, inconsiderate.
I’ve no purity, no devotion.”</p>

<p>“You’re incessantly interesting. You’re straight, swift,
and endlessly beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Bobby, truly! Does it look like that to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Doesn’t my manner—? Don’t you <i>know</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said gravely; “I suppose I know.”</p>

<p>She came to a stop in front of him with her arms akimbo.
They stood looking at one another, and Bobby winced as
if he was going to cry. Her face was grave and troubled,
and then at the sight of his expression her smile broke
through. Her gravity vanished. She was a different
Christina Alberta. She was suddenly the gayest conceivable
thing to him, confident and impudent.</p>

<p>“If you were to kiss me, Bobby, right here and now in
Bushey Park, would they lock us up?...”</p>

<p>Most wonderful it was to Bobby to take her in his arms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
A new Christina Alberta was revealed to Bobby; Christina
Alberta seen from a distance of six inches or so, an amazingly
beautiful Christina Alberta. One might have thought
she had never lived for anything but being loved by Bobby.</p>

<p>“You’re learning,” said Christina Alberta after a little
while. “Now do it all over again, Bobby. Nobody seems
to be looking....”</p>

<h4>§ 3</h4>

<p>Neither Lambone nor Devizes had seemed in the least
surprised at their engagement. Indeed their attitude of
gratified expectation was almost embarrassing. The young
couple had come down to Udimore with Devizes and Miss
Means under the ample protection of Miss Lambone almost
as though they had been appointed for each other
from the beginning of things.</p>

<p>But at Udimore there were further surprises and perplexities
for Bobby. All day Saturday Christina Alberta
seemed to be not so much in love as in a thoroughly bad
temper. She seemed far more concerned by the fact that
Devizes was going to marry Miss Means than by the
generous devotion that Bobby was prepared to lavish upon
her. She was inattentive to his various little manœuvres
to get isolated with her. The two couples played tennis
after tea until it was time to dress for dinner; she was
badly out of practice and fundamentally unorthodox, and
Margaret played with a smoothness and sweetness that
roused her to a pitch of viciousness only too evident to
Bobby’s fine perceptions. It seemed to Bobby that Devizes
also noted her annoyance, but Miss Means was blissfully
unobservant of anything in the world but Devizes.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning Christina Alberta carried off Bobby
through the distant cheerfulness of church bells for a walk
to Brede Castle. And she announced to Bobby that she
did not intend to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>Bobby protested. “You don’t love me?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I kissed you? Didn’t I hug you? Haven’t I
ruffled your hair?”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you want to marry me?”</p>

<p>“I do not want to marry anyone. I don’t love anybody.
Except of course you. But even you, I can’t marry. I
want to be loved, Bobby, yes. But not to be married.”</p>

<p>“But why? Not the—the old reason?”</p>

<p>“No. I took your word about that. But all the same I
don’t want to marry you, Bobby.... I think it’s because
I don’t want to be bound up with anyone’s life. I don’t
want to be a wife. I want to be my free and independent
self. I’ve got to grow. That’s it, Bobby. I want to be free
to grow.”</p>

<p>Bobby made protesting noises.</p>

<p>“I don’t want some one seeing me grow all the time.
You’d always be looking at me, Bobby; I know you
would.”</p>

<p>It was useless of Bobby to say he wouldn’t. He would.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that things were going to take me like this
until I fixed to marry you. I wanted to marry you when
I consented—honestly I did. I wanted dreadfully then to
get close to some one, as close as possible, and to be kissed
and told ‘There! There!’ and to keep there. It was a
comfort for me, Bobby. You are a comfort for me. I’d
ache to madness without you. But how close we come
when we love, Bobby, and how far away we are all the
time! How can we know each other when we hardly know
ourselves? When we don’t <i>dare</i> know ourselves?</p>

<p>“You are such a dear, Bobby. You are so warm and kind
that it seems ungrateful not to give myself to you with
both hands. But I just can’t. I’m not a normal woman
perhaps. Or something has happened to me unawares.
Perhaps life has cheated me out of something.... Oh, I
don’t know, Bobby. I want some one dreadfully; I want
you dreadfully and I don’t want you at all. I’d rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
be dead than a female thing like Margaret Means. If
<i>that’s</i> marrying——!”</p>

<p>“But I thought,” said Bobby, “after all that’s happened——”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait ten years for you,” said Bobby, “on the chance
of your altering your mind.”</p>

<p>“You are the dearest comforter,” said Christina Alberta,
and stopped short....</p>

<p>And suddenly she had put her hands upon his shoulders
and clung to him and broken into a wild passion of weeping.</p>

<p>“Wetting you instead of wedding you,” she sobbed and
laughed. “Oh, my poor Bobby! you dear lover!”</p>

<p>She clung to him for a time. Then she detached herself
and stood wiping her eyes, the Christina Alberta he generally
knew, except for the traces of her tears. “If women
can’t control their emotions better,” she said, “they’ll have
to go back to Harems. We can’t have it both ways. But
I <i>won’t</i> marry you. There’s no man in the world I can
marry. I’m going to be a free and independent woman,
Bobby. From now on.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand!” said Bobby.</p>

<p>“It’s not because I don’t want you to love me.”</p>

<p>He was baffled. “<i>Bobby!</i>” she whispered, and seemed to
glow.</p>

<p>Bobby took her back into his arms and held her, and
pressed his cheek and ears against hers, and kissed her
and kissed her again, and it seemed to him to mark his
own unworthiness that he should think at such a time that
there were no such wonderful kisses in the world as kisses
flavoured with salt tears.</p>

<p>And yet she wasn’t going to marry him! She had
snatched herself back from him and nevertheless she was
in his arms.</p>

<p>He was enormously perplexed at what was happening,
but it was quite clear that the end of his engagement was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
not to be the end of his love-making. Anyhow here was
love. It was so manifestly the time for love. High May
ruled the world. About them there were hawthorn trees
white with blossom and great bushes of elder just breaking
into flower.</p>

<h4>§ 4</h4>

<p>Bobby sat in the gloaming with his friends and thought
of the things that had happened to him that day, thought
of Christina Alberta’s salt tears and the incessant intriguing
strangeness of her ways. He was still immensely
puzzled, but now in a large, restful, contented fashion.
Christina Alberta and he were not to marry it seemed;
nevertheless he had kissed her and embraced her, and he
was free to sit at her feet. For a time he was not even to
humiliate himself by telling these others he was not to
marry her. He said nothing. His thoughts and feelings
were beyond words. Christina Alberta too was darkly
silent. Everyone indeed seemed preoccupied. Talk about
the view and the stars and the coming of the nightingales,
and about migratory birds and lighthouses rambled on for
a time and died away.</p>

<p>They were all too full for talking. The silence lengthened.
He wondered what would happen if nobody spoke any
more. He thought of Christina Alberta close behind him
and he began to quiver in all his being. The silence was
becoming oppressive. He felt as though he could no longer
change his attitude. Nobody stirred. But Lambone saved
the situation.</p>

<p>“It is exactly six months ago to-night that Sargon died
upstairs,” said Lambone. He paused and seemed to answer
an unspoken question. “We don’t know when he died
exactly. He just faded out in the night.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could have known him,” said Margaret Means
after quite a long interval.</p>

<p>Bobby’s thoughts came round to Sargon. That still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
young woman sitting in the darkness behind him ceased to
dominate his thoughts. He was moved to speak, and had
to cough to clear his throat.</p>

<p>“I hate to think of his being burnt and scattered,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s not so disagreeable,” said Miss Lambone, “as to
think of the body all shut up in the coffin and decaying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” cried Bobby. “It’s death—any death, that I
hate to think of. Now when it is spring time, when the
whole world is so full of life, I remember all he was, the
hopes he had, and they are scattered and dispersed.
Anyhow they are scattered and dispersed, they are not
boxed up and locked up and buried.... When I was
here last he was like a little boy who has just heard of
the world. He was going to fly, going to India and China,
going to learn all about everything and then do all sorts
of splendid things. And there were the beastly bacteria at
work in his lungs and beating his strength down and none
of it was ever to happen.... When first I heard he was
dead I could not believe it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Is</i> he dead?” said Paul Lambone.</p>

<p>There was no reply to be made to that.</p>

<p>Paul adjusted his shoulder-blades a little more comfortably
against the back of the small deep sofa on which
he sat. “The more I think over Sargon the less dead he
seems to me, and the more important he becomes. I don’t
agree with you, Roothing. I don’t find anything futile in
his life. I think he was—symbolically—perfect. I have
thought about him endlessly.”</p>

<p>“And talked,” said Devizes, “endlessly.”</p>

<p>“And given you some very helpful ideas for your treatment.
Don’t be ungrateful. You think that Sargon is over.
He has only just begun. You are becoming too professional
with success, Devizes. You begin to take up cases and
work them off and drop them out of your mind. You don’t
go on with them and learn. You don’t sit about and think
about them as I do. I continue to think about Sargon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
I go on with him because he is still a living being for me.
I have got a new religion from him, the religion of Sargonism.
I declare him prophet of a new dispensation. It is my
latest new religion. There will always be new religions, and
the new religions will always be the only ones that matter.
Religion is a living thing, and what is alive must be continually
dying and be continually born again—differently
but the same.”</p>

<p>“You believe in immortality, Mr. Lambone,” said Miss
Means. “I wish that I could. But when I try to imagine it
my wits fail me. Sometimes one seems to <i>feel</i> what it
might be. On a night like this perhaps——”</p>

<p>Her pretty clear voice died away in the stillness as the
trail of a falling star dies away.</p>

<p>Paul, a large dark lump on the dim pale sofa, went on
speaking. “Immortality,” he said, “is a mystery. One can
only speak of it in dark metaphors. How can we believe
that each of our individual commonplace lives is to have
an endless commonplace sequel? That is incredible nonsense.
Yet we go on living after death nevertheless. When
we die we are changed. All wise teachers have insisted
upon that. As Roothing said, we are not boxed up and
buried and forgotten. Our real death is an escape, and we
escape and become—what did you say?—dispersed. Immortal
life is endless consequence. Our lives are like lines
in a great poem. It is an unfinished and yet it is a perfect
poem. The line begins and ends but it has to be there,
and once it is there, it is there eternally. Nothing could
follow if it was not there. But every star has not the same
glory. Some lives, some lines, stand out as more significant
than the others. They open a new branch of the subject,
they start a new point of view, they express something
fresh. They are geniuses, they are prophets, they are
major stars. Sargon was the last, the latest of these
prophets, and I am his Paul. Not for nothing was I
christened Paul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>“Paul of Tarsus,” said Devizes, “was a man of energy.”</p>

<p>“There will always be minor differences in such parallels,”
said Lambone.</p>

<p>“I will tell you my doctrine,” he said.</p>

<p>He began to talk in that clear miniature voice of his,
which was so like a little mouse running out of the mountain
of his person, of Sargon and his struggles with his
individuality, and of the struggles in every man between
his individual life and something greater that is also in
him. There was a streak of fantasy in what he was saying,
a touch of burlesque in his constant use of theological
and religious phrasing, and withal a profound sincerity.
In every human being, he declared, the little laundryman
battled with the King of Kings. He expanded and amplified
his theme. Ever and again Devizes would cut into the
monologue and talk for a time, not so much to make objections
as to restate and amend and amplify. The others said
little. Margaret Means twice made soft sweet sounds suggestive
of intellectual sensuousness, and once Christina
Alberta said “But—!” very loudly and then “Never mind.
Go on” and relapsed for a long time into a silence that
could be felt. Bobby sat still, sometimes listening intently
and sometimes with his mind spreading out like an uncared-for
stream into a number of parallel channels. The
argument itself was interesting to follow, but moving at the
side of that was the question of the talker’s sincerity. How
much of all this stuff did Lambone mean? How much of
what he said was of a piece with the rest of his observant,
self-indulgent life, his life as a humorous comment on a
universe that was profoundly absurd?</p>

<p>How easily Lambone played with phrases and ideas for
which men had lived and died! How widely he had read
and thought to bring so many things together! He produced
a great effect of erudition. The Golden Bough he
had at his fingers’ ends. He talked of the sacramental
mysteries of half a dozen cults, from Mithraism to ritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
sacrifices, of varying ideas of personality that had held and
swayed human life from Fiji to Yucatan. Now he was in
pre-Christian Alexandria, and now among the Chinese
philosophers. The “Superior Person” of Confucius he declared
was merely an example of our way of translating
all Chinese phrases as ridiculously as possible; it meant
really the Higher and Greater Man, the Universal Man,
in whom the inferior egotistical man merged himself. It
was the salvation of the Revivalist everywhere; it was the
Spiritual Man of Pauline Christianity. When the late
Mr. Albert Edward Preemby poured out all his little being
into the personality of Sargon, King of Kings, he was only
doing over again what the saints and mystics, the religious
teachers and fanatics, have done throughout the ages. He
was just the Master under the Bo Tree translated into the
cockney of Woodford Wells.</p>

<p>Presently Devizes was talking. Devizes was a great
contrast to Lambone. He talked a different language. He
did not seem nearly so clear and clever to Bobby as Lambone
did, but he had an effect of sincerity and solidity of
conviction that Lambone lacked altogether. His interventions
made all that Lambone said seem like a wild and
picturesque parody of something that was otherwise inexpressible.
Both he and Lambone had an air of casting
verbal nets for some truth that still eluded them. And yet
this truth so remotely and imperfectly apprehended was
for each of them the most important thing in life.</p>

<p>“Stripped of its theological trappings,” Devizes said to
Lambone, “your new religion is simply a statement of this.
That our race has reached, and is now receding, from a
maximum of <i>individuation</i>. That it turns now towards
synthesis and co-operation. It will move back towards
what you call Sargon, the great ruler, and it will swallow
up individual egotistical men in its common aims. As
already scientific work swallows them up. Or good administrative
work. Or art. That is what you are saying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>“Exactly,” said Paul Lambone. “If we <i>must</i> talk your
language, Devizes, and not mine. Art, science, public service,
creative work of every sort, these are parts of what you,
I suppose, would call the race mind, parts of the race life.
Every man who matters is a fresh thought, a fresh idea.
He is himself still, it is true, but his significance is that he
comes out of his past and out of his conditions and he flows
on to further men. This is the new realization that is
changing all the values in human life. It is happening
everywhere. Even in the books and reading of to-day you
can see the thing happening. History now becomes more
important than biography. What made up the whole of
life in the romantic past; the love story, the treasure story,
the career, getting on, making a fortune, the personal deed
and victory, the sacrifices for an individual friend or love
or leader; remains no longer the whole of life and sometimes
not even the leading interest in life. We are passing
into a new way of living, into a new sort of lives, into new
relationships. The world which seemed for a time not to
be changing any more is changing very swiftly ... in its
mental substance.”</p>

<p>“New sorts of people,” said Bobby softly, and went off
from listening to Lambone’s lucid little voice into a final
recapitulation of the puzzling things Christina Alberta had
said and done that day.</p>

<h4>§ 5</h4>

<p>Bobby was recalled to the matter of the talk by a movement
in the chair behind him.</p>

<p>Lambone’s smooth voice was explaining: “So that it does
not matter so much what we achieve as what we contribute.
That cherished personal life which men and women struggle
to round off and make noble and perfect, disappears
from the scheme of things. What matters more and more
is the work one does. What matters less and less is our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
personal romance and our personal honour. Or rather our
honour will go out of us into our work. Our love affairs,
our devotions and private passions, for example, will fall
more and more definitely into a subordination to our
science or whatever our function is. Our romances and
our fame and honour will join our vices among the things
we suppress. There was a time when men lived for a noble
tomb and in order to leave sweet and great memories
behind them; soon it will matter nothing to a man and his
work to know that he will probably die in a ditch—misunderstood.
So long as he gets the work done.”</p>

<p>“With no last Judgment ever to vindicate him,” said
Devizes.</p>

<p>“That will not matter in the least to him.”</p>

<p>“I agree. Some of us begin to feel like that even now.”</p>

<p>“Even if one has done nothing worth doing,” said Paul
Lambone, and in his voice was that faint quality of the
sigh of one who has crowned a rather difficult and uncertain
card castle, “even if Sargon had died unrescued in his
Asylum and all the world had thought him mad, all the
same he would have escaped, his imagination would have
touched the imagination of the greater life.”</p>

<p>Came a pause of edification and then a sigh of satisfaction
from Miss Lambone. She never understood in the
least what her brother was talking about, but she adored
him when he talked. Nobody she thought had ever talked
like him, or could possibly talk like him. His voice was so
clear and bright, like the best sort of print. Only sometimes
you wished you had spectacles.</p>

<p>But now Miss Lambone was to receive a shock. Christina
Alberta suddenly came out of the silence in which she had
been sitting.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in this,” said Christina Alberta out of
the depths of her chair.</p>

<p>Bobby was beginning to know the voice of Christina
Alberta very well; and he knew now that she was terrified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
at having to talk, and at the same time desperately resolved
to get something said. He knew too that she was gripping
hard at the arms of her chair. He glanced at Devizes and
in that instant the lighthouse beam touched his face and
Bobby saw it very intent, watching Christina Alberta
steadily and as if forgetful of all other things. It was intent
and tender and tenderly apprehensive, grave and very pale
in that white illumination. When the light had passed
away Bobby still seemed to see that face, but now conversely
it was a face of ebony.</p>

<p>“I do not believe in <i>any</i> of this,” said Christina Alberta.</p>

<p>She paused with the effect of marshalling her argument.
“It is theology, I suppose,” she said. “Or mysticism. It is
all an intellectual game that men have played to comfort
themselves. Men rather than women. It makes no real
difference. Tragedy <i>is</i> tragedy, failure <i>is</i> failure, death is
death.”</p>

<p>“But is there ever complete failure?” asked Lambone.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said Christina Alberta, “suppose a man is
thrown into prison and misrepresented to all the world,
suppose he is taken away presently and made to dig his
own grave, and shot at the edge of it and buried and then
lied about for a time and forgotten. It isn’t part of the
race that is murdered, it isn’t a wonderful thing that passes
on; it is a man who has been killed and made away with.
Your mysticism is just an attempt to dodge the desolation
of that. It doesn’t. Such things have happened. They
happen to-day. In Russia. In America. Everywhere.
Men are just wiped out, body and soul, hope and will.
That man and his black personal universe are done with
and over, and there is an end to his business; he is beaten
and wiped out, and all the clever talk upon easy sofas in
the warm twilight will not alter that one jot. It is frustration.
If I am frustrated I am frustrated, if I have desires
and dreams and they are defeated and die, I die. It is
playing with words to say I do not die or that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
changed and sublimated and carried on into something
better.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Miss Lambone to Miss Means. “You
are sure you are not feeling cold?” Her voice conveyed a
faint intimation that she would cease to be acutely interested
in the talk if this chit of a girl intervened any
further in the discussion, and that she would begin to do
things with wraps and shawls and break up the meeting.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly happy, dear,” Miss Means answered.
“All this—! I wish it could go on for ever.”</p>

<p>But Christina Alberta disregarded Miss Lambone’s warning.
She had something to say and there was some one
she wanted to say it to, not too pointedly, not too plainly.</p>

<p>“All this theology, this religion, the new religions that
are only the old ones painted over——”</p>

<p>“Reborn,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“Painted over. I don’t want them. But that is not what
I want to say. What I want to say is that you are wrong
about my Daddy, you are quite wrong about him. That I
do know. Mr. Lambone has dressed him up to suit his
own philosophy. He had that philosophy long before he
knew him. And you talked my Daddy over and put Mr.
Lambone’s ideas into him when he was beaten and broken
because they suited his case. They weren’t there before.
I know him and exactly how he thought. I was brought up
on him. He talked to me more than to anyone. And it is
all nonsense to talk of him—his exaltation, as being like
the great soul coming like the tidal sea into the pool of the
little soul. It didn’t. When he said he was Lord of the
World he wanted to be Lord of the World. He didn’t want
to incorporate any other people at all—or be incorporated.
He was just as exclusively himself when he was Sargon as
when he was Albert Edward Preemby. More so.... And
I believe that is how it is with all of us.”</p>

<p>She went on rather hurriedly, for she knew there were
forces there very ready to silence her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>“I want to be myself and nothing else. I want the world—for
myself. I want to be a goddess in the world. It does
not matter that I am an ugly girl with natural bad manners.
It does not matter that it is impossible. That is what I
want. That is what I am made to want. One may get
moments anyhow. A moment of glory is better than none....
I believe that sort of thing is what you all want really.
You just persuade yourselves you don’t. And you call that
religion. I don’t believe anyone has ever believed religion
from the beginning. Buddhism, Christianity, this fantastic
Sargonism, this burlesque religion you invent to make an
evening’s talk, they are all consolations and patchings-up—bandages
and wooden legs. People have tried to believe
in such religions no doubt. Broken people. But because
we cannot satisfy the desires of our hearts—why should we
cry ‘Sour grapes’ at them?</p>

<p>“I don’t want to serve—anything or anybody. I may be
heading for frustration, the universe may be a system of
frustration, but that doesn’t alter the fact that this is how
I feel about it. I may be defeated; it may be certain that I
shall be defeated—but as for bringing a contrite heart out
of the mess and starting again as a good little part of something—I
<i>don’t</i> fink. Oh, I know I beat my hands against a
wall. It’s not my fault. Why don’t we take? Oh, why
don’t we dare?”</p>

<p>Miss Lambone stirred and rustled.</p>

<p>The darkness that was Devizes spoke to Christina Alberta,
and Miss Lambone became still.</p>

<p>“We don’t take and we don’t dare,” he said, “we don’t
defy laws and customs because there are other things in
our lives, <i>in</i> us and not outside us, that are more important
to us. That is why. It pleases Paul to dress up his view
of these things in old mystical phrasing, but what he
says is really an unscientific way of putting psychological
fact. You think you are simple, but you are really complex.
You are the individual but you are the race also. That is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
your nature and mine and everyone’s. The more our
intelligence awakens the more we know that.”</p>

<p>“But it is the difference that is distinctively me, and not
the general part. The race in me is no more to me than
the ground I walk on. I am Christina Alberta; I am not
Woman or Mankind. As Christina Alberta, I want and I
want and I want. And when the door is slammed upon my
imaginations I cry out against it. Why pretend I give up a
thing because I can’t have it? Why make a glory of renunciation
and letting-go? I hate the idea of self-sacrifice.
What is the good of coming into the world as Christina
Alberta just in order to sacrifice being Christina Alberta?
What is the good of being different if one is not to live a
different life?”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly Miss Lambone intervened, “The life of a
woman is one long sacrifice,” she said.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“But we have the vote now?” said Christina Alberta
almost flippantly. “Why is a woman’s life sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“Think of the children we bear,” said Miss Lambone in a
constrained voice.</p>

<p>“<i>Well!</i>” said Christina Alberta, and suppressed some
scandalous remark.</p>

<p>“The most astonishing thing about us,” she broke out
again, after a pause; “the most astonishing thing in the
feminine make-up is that hardly any of us <i>do</i> seem to want
children. A lot of us anyhow don’t. Now that I am beginning
to learn something about biology, I realize how marvellous
that is. As a race of creatures specialized for children,
we ought to be eaten up by the desire for children.
As a matter of fact most modern women will do anything
to avoid having children. We dread them. To me they
seem like a swarm of hidden dwarfs, prepared to come
upon me and eat up my whole existence. It’s not simply
I don’t want them; I live in fear of them. Love we <i>may</i>
want. Many of us do. Intensely. We want to love and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
loved—to get close and near to some one. It’s a delusion I
suppose. One of Nature’s clumsy tricks. It is all a delusion.
He vanishes—he was never there. Under the old conditions
it availed; it got the children Nature wanted. But we
don’t think of children. We don’t want to think about
them. There it is! And anyway children do not take a
woman out of her egotism; they only extend and intensify
it. I have known intelligent girls marry and have children,
and when the baby appeared their minds evaporated. They
became creatures of instinct, messing about with napkins.
I could scream at the thought of it. No, I am an egoist
pure and simple. I am Christina Alberta, and her only.
I am not Sargon. I refuse altogether to mix with that
promiscuous anybody-nobody.”</p>

<p>“After all that may only be a phase in your development,”
said Devizes.</p>

<p>“It is the only one I know.”</p>

<p>“That is evident. But I assure you, Christina Alberta,
that this revolt and distress of yours is a phase. You are
talking rebellion and egoism and anarchism as a healthy
baby screams to get breath into its lungs, and escape from
the stuffiness of old air. The baby doesn’t know why it
screams and no doubt finds some dim little grievance in
its brain——”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Christina Alberta. “Chastise me and
chastise me.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Bobby that there were tears in her voice.</p>

<p>“No, but you are so young, my dear,” said Devizes.</p>

<p>My dear!</p>

<p>“Not so young. Not so actually young,” cried Christina
Alberta.</p>

<p>“If I live to be eighty,” said Christina Alberta, “shall I
ever be able to feel more than I am feeling now? Why will
you always treat me like a child nowadays?”</p>

<p>“Feeling isn’t the only measure,” said Devizes. “Even
now, to-night, you are talking below your beliefs. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
are not an egoistic adventurer. You take sides on a score
of matters. You insist you are a Communist for example.”</p>

<p>“Oh! just to smash up things,” said Christina Alberta.
“Just to smash up everything.”</p>

<p>“No. You say that to-night, but you have told me
differently before. You have a care for the world. You
want to help forward the common interest. You develop
a passion for scientific truth. Well—there’s no way of
fencing in your individuality from other minds in science
or in public affairs. You’re a part by necessity; you can’t
be a complete whole. You find already you can’t keep
away from these things. They will take you more and
more, whether you like it or not, because it is the spirit
of the time. That is what is happening to us all. You
can’t escape. Our work, our part, is the first thing in
our lives. To that, pride must bow now and passion and
romance. We have to slam and lock and bar the door
against all personal passion that might wreck our work.
Bar it and put it out of your mind. As a secondary thing.
Work. Give the greater things a chance to keep you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well.”</p>

<p>“It’s everything.”</p>

<p>“Why <i>should</i> they keep me?” came from Christina Alberta,
sullenly and resolutely.</p>

<p>“I know that this is your faith,” she said. “You told
me all about it. You’ve always told me about it.” Bobby’s
quick ear detected a change in her voice “Do you remember
our first talk together? Do you remember our
talk in Lonsdale Mews? When we dined together at that
Italian place? That night. Just after we had found each
other.”</p>

<p>Found each other?</p>

<p>“But I did not know then that your faith meant all the
suppressions and sacrifices and discretions it seems to do.
I thought it was something robust and bold. I did not
understand its—qualifications. But since then we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
argued about these things and argued. That day at Kew
Gardens. That day when you took me for that walk over
the downs to Shere. We have threshed things out. Why
should we argue again? I am giving in—what can I do
but give in?—and soon I will be a Sargonite with you and
Paul. But not this summer. Not now. This night—This
wonderful first night of summer. To-night I rebel against
any renunciation, any fobbing-off of individuals with
second-best things. I am going to be impossible and
absurd. For the last time. I want the world from the stars
to the bottom of the sea for myself, for my own hungry
self. And all between. The precious things between. The
love.... <i>There!</i>”</p>

<p>Vague questions appeared and vanished again on the
screen of Bobby’s mind. What had Christina Alberta
renounced? What was she renouncing? What was anyone
renouncing? And had his ears cheated him, or had Devizes
called her, “my dear”? In front of Margaret Means and in
face of all the circumstances of the case it seemed to
Bobby that Devizes was the last person who ought to call
Christina Alberta “my dear.” And what was this about
“fobbing-off”? Was this really a shameless plainness of
speech, an atrocious confession, or something that he misunderstood?</p>

<p>Miss Lambone stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>It was as if an evil spirit possessed Christina Alberta.
“Oh, <i>damn</i> renunciation!” she said with bitter gusto.</p>

<p>They seemed to be sitting for some moments in a profound
silence, and then the nightingale became very audible.</p>

<h4>§ 6</h4>

<p>“I think,” said Miss Lambone in the silence, “that it is
getting just a <i>leetle</i> chilly.”</p>

<p>“It is so beautiful here,” said Miss Means, who was warm
in Miss Lambone’s shawl. “Perfectly beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>“How you can talk of frustration—!” she added, and left
her sentence incomplete.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Miss Lambone, “that I shall go in and
light the candles. It is too wonderful a night for the electric
lights, far too wonderful. We will just light the candles
and the fire. And perhaps you will play us something
beautiful. These are such marvellous fire-places here that
they blaze up at once. I don’t know if you have noticed
them—a new sort. The fire is all on the hearth—no
draught below, but the shape of the back draws it up.</p>

<p>“I love a wood fire,” said Miss Lambone, and sighed and
rose slowly and voluminously.</p>

<h4>§ 7</h4>

<p>Two days later Bobby came into one of the little studies
on the garden side of Paul Lambone’s house. Paul had
found out that Bobby wanted a few days of uninterrupted
thought in which to begin his novel, and had asked him to
stay on after the other guests had returned to London.
It was a perfect room for a writer of Bobby’s temperament;
it had a low writing-table close to the sill of the casemented
window, and on the sill was a silver bowl of forget-me-nots
and white tulips. A little glass-paned door released one
into the garden without one’s having to go back through
the house. The writing-table had everything a fastidious
writer could desire, a pleasant paper-rack and wafers, and
real quill pens, and plenty of elbow room. The chair he
sat in was an arm-chair, immensely comfortable but not
too luxurious; no hint of repose in it but only a completely
loyal support for a working occupant. A garden
path ran up hill from the window, a garden path skirted
by wonderful clusters of pansies. On either side of the
pansies were rose bushes, and though not a rosebud was
showing, yet the fresh green leaves, tinged with ruddy
brown, were very exquisite in the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>He stood looking up the path for a time and then sat
down and drew the writing-pad towards him. He took one
of those delightful quills, tested the delicious flexibility of
its points, dipped it in the ink and wrote in his very neat
and beautiful handwriting:</p>

<br>
<small>BY ROBERT ROOTHING</small><br>
<br>
CHAPTER THE FIRST<br>
<br>
<small>WHICH INTRODUCES OUR HERO</small></p>

<p>He wrote this very readily because it was very familiar
to him. From first to last he had written it on fair fresh
sheets of paper perhaps half a dozen times.</p>

<p>Then he stopped short and sat quite still with his head on
one side. Then very neatly he corrected “which introduces”
into “in which we introduce.”</p>

<p>It was nearly two years now since he had first begun his
novel in this fashion, and he was still quite uncertain about
the details of his hero’s introduction. His original intention
about the story still floated pleasantly in the sky of
his mind; a promise of a happy succession of fine, various
and delightful adventures, told easily and good-humouredly;
the fortunes of a kindly, unpretending, not too brave
but brave enough young man, on his way through the
world, to live happily afterwards with a delicious young
woman. “Picaresque” was the magic word. None of these
adventures had as yet assumed a concrete form in his mind.
He felt they would come to him definitely enough one day.
If one sat and mused one half saw them, and that was
assurance enough for him. And so having rewritten his
title page neatly and prettily, he fell into a day-dream and
was presently thinking round and about his Christina
Alberta as a good hero should.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>Bobby was always being puzzled by Christina Alberta,
always coming upon something that seemed to clear up
everything, and then being puzzled again. But now it
seemed to him that he really did know the last fact of
importance that was to be known about her. Overnight
Paul Lambone had described how he had taken her to
Devizes to get advice, and how they had blundered upon
the reality of her parentage. He told his story well as a
story-writer should; he gave it dramatic point. Evidently
he told the tale of set intention, because it was time Bobby
knew. Lambone was aware of Christina Alberta’s
engagement. He did not know and nobody but Bobby
knew that she never intended to be married. But this, it
seemed to Bobby, made the understanding of her situation
possible; explained that watchful tenderness of Devizes’
face suddenly betrayed by the light of his inadvertent
“my dear”; explained her position as though she belonged
to him and Paul Lambone instead of being a rather unaccountable
visitor; excused her vehement jealousy of
Margaret Means, because evidently she had become violently
possessive of her father, and had counted perhaps
upon recognition and being very much with him. No
doubt Margaret Means stood in the way of that. It was
natural for Christina Alberta to want to be with Devizes
and work with him, and natural for her to suspect and
anticipate and resent an intervening personality. Apart
from the magic of kinship it was natural that two such
subtle and abundant personalities should attract each other
greatly. That Devizes should have decided quite abruptly
to marry Margaret Means did not present any difficulties
to Bobby; he was not thinking very closely about Devizes.
Margaret Means was pretty enough for anyone to want to
marry her. There are times, as Bobby knew, when that
sweet prettiness can stab one like an arrow. It had evidently
stabbed and won Devizes. And almost the only
thing that gave Bobby a second thought, but no more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
a second thought, was Christina Alberta’s fluctuation of
purpose, why she should have consented to marry him and
then have changed her mind so quickly and definitely and
yet have retained him as a lover.</p>

<p>That resolution not to marry seemed after all just a part
of her immense modernity. Because of all this group of
“new people” in which he found her, she seemed to Bobby
to be in every way the newest. She was the boldest enterprise
in living he had ever met. Her flare of hungry rebel
individuality fascinated him. Where in this world was
she going? Would she win out to this free personal life she
desired or would she fail to find an objective of work and
come upon disappointment and solitude like some creature
that has strayed? The world had terrified Bobby in his
own person greatly; it terrified him still more when he
thought of this valiant little figure going out to challenge it.</p>

<p>Bobby was naturally, inherently, afraid; his instinct was
for security, protection, kindliness and help. He clung to
his “Aunt Suzannah” job for safety. He didn’t believe
Christina Alberta knew one tenth of the dangers she ran of
insult, defeat, humiliation, neglect, repulse, fatigue and
lonely distress. His imagination presented a tormenting
picture of her away there in dark, confused, immense and
blundering London, as an excessively fragile figure, light
on its feet, shock-head erect, arms akimbo, unaware of
monstrous ambushed dangers. Now that he began to
understand her, he began to understand a great number of
bright-eyed, adventurous, difficult young women he had
met in the last few years, and he had his first dim realization
of the meaning of the deep wide stir among womankind
that had won them votes and a score of unprecedented
freedoms.</p>

<p>Many of these younger women were doing their work
and holding their own exactly like men. They were painting
and drawing like men, writing criticism like men, writing
plays and novels like men, leading movements, doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
scientific work, playing a part in politics. Like men? On
reflection—not exactly. No. They still kept different.
But they didn’t do their things in any fashion one could
call womanly. Without adding strange new meanings to
“womanly.” The novels they were writing interested him
immensely. People like Stella Benson wrote books like—anybody;
you could not tell from her work whether she
was a man or a woman. All that again was new. George
Eliot perhaps was a precursor. Perhaps. The former sort
of women’s writings, when they were not “pretty me” books,
were “kindly auntie” books; you heard the petticoats swish
in every page.</p>

<p>Sexless, these new ones? Bobby weighed the word. The
earlier generation of women who wanted to be emancipated
suppressed sex, suppressed it so fiercely that its
negative presence became the dominant factor in their
lives. They ceased to be positive woman; they became
fantastically negative woman. But this newer multitude
was not so much repressing as forgetting their sex, making
little of it. Christina Alberta had in a way made nothing
of her sex, not by struggling against it, but by making it
cheap for herself as a man makes it cheap for himself—so
that it was a thing of mere intermittent moods and impulses
for her—and she could go on to other things.</p>

<p>Going on to other things. His imagination recurred to
that little figure resolved to conquer the world for itself in
defiance of every tradition.</p>

<p>There was a strong urgency in him to start off to London
in pursuit of her, to hover about her, intervene, protect
her and carry her off to security. He knew she wouldn’t
permit that sort of thing to happen anyhow. He’d have to
be just a friend and companion to her, be at hand for her,
and if she did encounter some disaster, stand by her.</p>

<p>It was a queer thing that he should want to stand by this
unsexed young woman. It was just what one would not
expect; it was part, perhaps, of the immense biological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
changes of the time. In the past the species had needed
half the race specialized for child-bearing and child-rearing;
now plainly it didn’t. The tremendous and worshipful
dignity of wife and mother was not for all women any
longer. That would remain for a certain sort of them to
take up if they would. But a vast multitude of women
were born now to miss that. Some would become pretty
nuisances who would presently cease to be pretty, parasites
on love and the respect for motherhood; shams, simulacra.
Others would break away to a real individual life—a third
sex. Perhaps in the new world there would cease to be two
sexes only; there would be recognized varieties and subdivisions.
So Bobby speculated. For just as there were
women who did not want to bear children, so there were
men who did not want to lord it over wife and children.</p>

<p>They would want to love all the same. Every individual
of a social species needed love; to fail in that need was to
escape out of social life to lonely futility. “Mutual comfort,”
Bobby quoted. In his past Bobby had dreamt of the
love of children. Even now he remembered as a fact that
he had dreamt particularly of a little girl of his own that
he could protect and explore. But now the thought and
interest of Christina Alberta had blotted that out. It was
extraordinary to him to perceive how possessed he was by
her. He could endure no prospect of life just now unless
it was to include Christina Alberta as its principal fact.
But he’d be no use to her unless she respected him. He
couldn’t hope to stand subordinate to her, any more than
he could hope to be her master. In the latter case she’d
rebel; in the former, she’d despise. They would have to
stand side by side. And since she was clever, able and
resolved to work hard and distinguish herself, he must
word hard and also distinguish himself too. He had to be
her equal and remain and keep himself her equal....</p>

<p>That, in fact, was why he was going to write a great
novel—not just a novel but a great one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>He looked again at the neatly written page. “Ups and
Downs,” he read. “A Pedestrian Novel.”</p>

<p>It dawned upon him that there was something profoundly
wrong about that.</p>

<p>It was to have been a story of wandering about in the
world that is; the story of the happy adventures of a well
tempered mind in a well understood scheme of things.
But Bobby was beginning to realize that there is not, and
there never has been, a world that is; there is only a world
that has been and a world that is to be. “New people,”
whispered Bobby, and dipped a quill in the ink and made
a border of dots round his title. Then suddenly he crossed
out those three words “Ups and Downs” and wrote instead,
“New Country.”</p>

<p>“That might be the title of any novel that matters,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p>He mused deeply. Then he altered the sub-title to “The
History of an Explorer.”</p>

<p>He scratched out “Explorer.”</p>

<p>“Involuntary traveller,” said Bobby.</p>

<p>Finally he put back “A Pedestrian Novel” as his sub-title....</p>

<p>He became aware of an intermittent dull tapping, and
following the sound discovered a thrush trying to break
up a snail on the gravel path. But the gravel path was too
fine and soft to give a firm anvil for the beating. “The silly
bird ought to find a brick or a potsherd,” said Bobby and
reflected. “I suppose all the flower-pots are shut up in the
shed....</p>

<p>“I don’t like to see that bird wasting the morning and
being disappointed....</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t take a minute....”</p>

<p>He got up, let himself out by the little glass door beside
the window and went to find a brick. Presently he returned
with it.</p>

<p>But he did not go back into the study because while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
he had been looking for the brick, he had seen a young
blackbird which had got under the strawberry netting,
and was evidently scared out of its silly wits. So he
went back to see about the blackbird. The minutes passed
and he did not reappear. Perhaps he had found some
other fellow-creature in trouble.</p>

<p>Presently a little breeze blew into the study through the
open glass door, and lifted the sheet of paper which was to
introduce our hero, and wafted it softly and suggestively
on to the unlit wood fire upon the hearth. There it lay for
a long time.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
